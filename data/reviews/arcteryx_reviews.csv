"Arc'teryx","Proton LT Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","4181118",4,"40"" chest
32-33"" waist

I didn't buy this, but tried it on at the local Arcteryx store in Boston while shopping for a new shell. I have an Atom LT, so I'll compare it directly to that. 

Fabric: Seems more durable than the Atom, and more closely resembles the Gamma series in overall feel, which I prefer.

Fit: It feels trimmer overall, and is most noticeable in the waist and arm holes. The waist is fine for me, and had enough room for a t-shirt and wool baselayer. I have larger shoulders, and the arm holes felt restrictive in the pit area. I can't tell if it's fabric build-up, or needs more room in the arm hole/chest , but I found it uncomfortable, and wouldn't like it for everyday wear.

Open up the pit area a bit, and I'd probably take the Proton over the Atom. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-02-19 00:00:00","",""

I have warmer down jackets for sub zero temperatures but that was not my intended purpose for the cerium lt. This jacket is perfect for chilly morning hikes and as a winter ski midlayer. Having an ultralight down jacket is essential in the Rockies, so I did my homework before picking this one up to get something I could use for summer backpacking and winter use. Having a jacket that is well rounded and can be used in a variety of conditions is important in my book and I am excited to put it to use for years to come. The cerium lt is great in temperatures in the 50’s to 30’s with just a t shirt but when it gets colder a nice flannel or fleece is always important.

Do not have this jacket on if it starts raining! Arcteryx was of no help in there warranty department so far. I was only offered a discount on a new purchase.

"Arc'teryx","Cerium LT Hooded Down Jacket - Men's","6329348",5,"Size:
I normally wear an XL jacket or shirt and this arcteryx jacket was no exception.

Fit:
Jacket has a great athletic style fit to it.  Makes even us ""soft shaped"" individuals look athletic!  Does not make you look like a marshmallow.  The high loft down means the jacket is quite thin and still warm.  Length and sleeves are perfect for me.

Function:
I brought this on a 4 day backpack trip to isle royale and it was just what the doctor ordered.  It packs down to about half the size of a Nalgene during the day (amazing).  At night you can unpack it and be comfortable well below freezing.  I wear it in winter with my arcteryx beta at hardshell when the weather really goes south.  

Quality:
The quality is outstanding.  The coat feels great. The zipper feels a little small to be durable, but they have never given me any trouble.  If they do, I have a lifetime warranty.  The coreloft around the chin, wrists, and pits is brilliant.  Depending on the activity you may break a sweat in this; you don't want that sweat to destroy your insulating capabilities.  For me I sweat and vent from the wrists and the coreloft holds up great there.

Cost:
I can not personally tell you if a $400 jacket is right for you.  I got mine cheaper from steep and cheap.  I was hesitant at first but have never looked back since I got my hands on the jacket.

Finally thoughts:
Do not bring this on  backpacking trip hoping it will double as your pillow.  850 fill power down makes for a terrible pillow.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-11-25 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

He stands outside a lot greeting customers so he needed a jacket that would be warm enough to keep him warm while stationary and versatile enough to keep him comfortable while moving heavy luggage and running around. This jacket has exceeded our expectations. 

We've determined the temperature range for this jacket is minimum -3F to a more comfortable 40F with the sweet spot being between 15F to 30F. It has been snowing quite a bit in Idaho this season and the DWR treated down creates some water resistance for when he gets caught out in a light snow storm.

He also uses this jacket under a waterproof shell while skiing. Any cold winds that the outer shell lets through the Arc'teryx Thorium AR absorbs. It has a nice athletic fit that is super easy to move around in and extremely light weight.

It has a drop tail, fit under a shell in puffiness and in length. Wrist elastic is sized well for my large hands and wrists. Hood fits with OR without helmet. With a helmet, all zipped up, the collar comes up to under my nose. Perfect.

However without a helmet, the elastic hood isn't great. I think it handles cold, but I get snowdrift blown down my back and neck all the time. Lame. Needs the adjustment the Cerium SL has.

The waist cinch on mine was terrible. But the Cerium SL didn't have this... maybe because it sucked. Most jackets have one or two pulls, and a light yank seals you up from drafts. This thing feels like I'm going to tear or break something, and needs a lot of pull for a little cinch.

I really like the coreloft. But when I climb, I stuff my gloves in my shell to stay warm and keep pushing moisture through their goretex layer. That means I always have a flat spot of wet down on my stomach or my ribs. Coreloft here would be great.

Or Arcteryx, why don't you offer this thing with water-resistant down like everyone else figured out? Then I would be forced to buy this thing again, supposing it had an adjustable hood and better waist. Argh.

I really liked the weight. Nice, heavier midlayer. They didn't waste grams here, so it's just warmer.

Oh, except with the separate stuff sack. They could have made a packable pocket, which I would really prefer...

Let's start off with the look. It looks GOOD. I got it in the Atlatnis Green color and it is amazing. It's really an amazing color.  The athletic fit keeps it a little more form fitting, and less boxy, which I prefer. I'm 5'8.5 and about 145. I wear mediums in pretty much all jackets/fleece, and this is no different. I probably could have purchased a small, but I don't think it would have given me much flexibility with what I decide to wear underneath.

Warmth-wise, it appears to do the trick. I have worn it in temperatures ranging from single digits to 35degrees. While I wouldn't say it is a standalone jacket for single digits, it did an admirable job when paired with a good mid-layer fleece.

As to quality. it seems to be typical of Arc'teryx. The only thing I haven't loved is a little loss of down. It isn't anything crazy, just here and there there will be feathers on my shirts and fleece layers. Other down jackets I have owned have lost some feathers, but not as quickly as this.

On the warmer days (I consider mid 20s to the mid 30s warmer) I layered with a thermal and smart wool sweater, and again it was perfect. A few times when it got warmer and I was working hard I would just unzip the pit vents and it was all good. The pit vents are a feature that I actually really liked because they’re not just a small opening with mesh. When unzipped they’re wide open and actually vent really well and quickly. The hood fit perfect over my Bern helmet when it was snowing. So far it seems incredibly durable. I wore it on a backcountry day with a lot of tree skiing. I definitely caught myself on a few wayward branches but the Saber held up perfectly. When looking for the jacket I was really concerned about fit. I didn’t want a big baggy jacket, but I also wanted to be able to layer underneath and fit a nano puff jacket for the cold days. I’m 6’1”, 185 Ibs and athletic build. Typically, all clothes (shirts, jackets, sweaters) that I wear are Large, but the Medium was just the right fit to have room to layer underneath while still feeling like it was a streamlined jacket. Not baggy at all, but still big enough to fully move my arms in any direction. I was a little gun shy on the price, but everything I had read said that the make and the quality of Arcteryx jackets was second to none. I usually hold onto my gear for about 7-10 years, so I went for it. When I received it I realized what everyone was talking about. You could see that time and care was put into making the jacket. I’ll be holding onto this jacket and using it for the next ten years.""","EMPLOYEE","2017-02-06 00:00:00","I gave it as a gift but have feedback to share",""
"Arc'teryx","Sabre Jacket - Men's","1571962",5,"I gave it as a gift but this is what he reported back to me,

I love this jacket, beacuse it delivers exactly what it promises to deliver. I would like to use this review to explain this, and to address two big issues I have with a lot of these seemingly confused reviews going around. Nothing about this jacket should surprise anyone. Here's why:
First: It's a Paclite jacket. Obviously it's not as durable and/or breathable as Pro or Active. But it's cheaper and its lighter, and it delivers exactly the same wind- and rain protection. If anyone says a Pro is more rainproof, they're wrong. Pro is more durable (construction mainly) and breathable, and Active is more breathable and (perhaps) slightly more durable (construction). However, this jacket does sport a 40 denier face fabric (although not the super-tough N40p-x, like the Alpha FL), and as such, it is a pretty burly Paclite jacket. For the same reason, it's not the lightest on the market. But for a 40 denier face fabric jacket, it probably is.
Second: It might not have pit zips, and it only has one pocket, but this should be very clear just by looking at it. If you know you want pit zips or more pockets, buy a jacket, that has those features. Just know that it will be heavier, and it will cost more. Because, you know, pit zips and pockets weigh more than just fabric, and putting them in takes time and therefore costs money. Complaining that a jacket, you bought, has no pit zips, is like bying a sportscar and complain that you can't fit your entire family in the backseat. Obviously, the car is not therefore flawed, you purchased the wrong car.
Like I said, I love this jacket. It is easily light enough to earn its place in my pack on every outdoor occasion, and I have no worries pulling it on for rough use. If you want a lighter jacket, look elsewhere, but be prepared for something like 10-15 denier and much less durability. If you want more versatility (read: durability and breathability), go for the Alpha FL, which weighs only 20 grams more. It does cost 50% more, but I think it's a bargain. I don't feel like I need more durability, but I also don't want a lot less, so for me, this is a great choice. I'm sure I would love the FL too.
And for the five stars: It's quite simply beautifully made, for what it is, and Arc'teryx are very up-front about what it is. There should be no surprises with this one, only expected satisfaction.","EMPLOYEE","2017-02-04 00:00:00","I gave it as a gift but have feedback to share","true"

"Arc'teryx","Sabre Jacket - Men's","845502319",5,"I'm going into my second season with the Arcteryx Sabre jacket. I'm somewhat fickle with my purchases, and tend to buy lots of different things and return/resell/gift stuff I'm not particularly  impressed with. Initially, I was concerned, because the size large was HUGE. I'm 6'1, 195 pounds, and tend to like a less baggy fit when going through trees. The length on the medium is perfect, the powder skirt snaps at the right spot on the hips and keeps the pow out. The torso is a little leaner on me in medium, but there is still plenty of room for layering.

Having used this in varying conditions from negative degree days in waist-deep powder to skiing in mixed/freezing rain conditions, it's kept me dry every time. Even when all of my friends are soaked and want to go to the lodge or car, I'm always dry enough and warm enough to keep going.

It's also quite durable. Tight tree lines have a particular magnetism to me and sometimes my affinity for them is punishing. In one particular instance, I nailed my shoulder on a stubby limb hard enough to spin me and cause one ski to eject. The point of impact was right on the shoulder seam - a little debris smear was left right on the seam. The weld was good inside and out, and aside from wiping off the bark smear, no damage was done, although I was left with a pretty healthy bruise underneath. I feel like the construction and materials are as bomber live up to the high expectations set by the brand.

Here are the Good/Neutral points:
They run a bit more narrow then your traditional shoe.   So if your foot is on the narrow side of things then these will fit you great.
They are definitely waterproof.  I have been dragging my feet through snow and slush over the last few weeks and my feet were super dry the whole time.
The construction seems pretty solid.  Now I haven't been able to abuse these as much as I would like, but they seem like they would hold up to a lot of abuse.
The sole of this shoe is very good, everything you would expect from a Vibram sole.

Now the Bad Things:
They are pretty hard to get on and off.  Some this isn't an issue for but some it is.  There were definitely times I was cursing it and other times that they seemed to slide on easily.
The biggest thing that bothered me was the heel cup.  First there isn't enough padding.  Second the heel cup is too big.  It doesn't seem to hold your heel in place.  When I was hiking up steep slopes my heel would hit the back of the heel and after 10 steps it would get uncomfortable quick.  I couldn't imagine 15 miles in them.

That is what you get when a company tries to jump into a new category.  I'm sure the shoes to come will be improved and everything we expect from Arcteryx.  They just aren't quite there with their boots.","EMPLOYEE","2016-02-08 00:00:00","I've used it several times","true"

It takes a minute to put them on the first time you try because of how you have to hold the inner liner open, but once your foot is in it's just cradled in there.

Sizing is spot on with all of my athletic shoes.  I tried on both a 12 and a 12.5 and went with the bigger size, which makes sense given that I wear a 12 in any kind of standard footwear, but a 12.5 in athletic shoes for running, tennis, etc.

Initial Reaction-
Upon opening up and trying on this I can tell they are serious for some mountaineering. This jacket had many pockets properly placed and with full waterproofing. It fit very well, with a little tightness in the shoulders. The convenient design of this jacket with its use of zipper, velcro and snap buttons, shows this is for some serious hiking and climbing. The material feels strong and capable.
-Zippers don't catch on anything
-Sturdy waterproofing on the zippers
-Well working hood with full head coverage
Sizing seems true, I ordered Medium which is what I usually wear and It fits perfectly, with good room for movement in the arms, and around the waist. All of this without it popping up too high while bending over. I feel well covered!
Two weeks in-
No complaints so far after regular use!
The waterproofing on this stuff is ridiculous! As expected from Gore-tex this material is extremely water repellent and hold up well under regular use in snow and rain. The hood can be very well secured under windy conditions and tightening elastics works well.
Conclusion-Amazing waterproof shell jacket for the price, that will surely work well years after purchase If properly taken care of.

After a couple of hours of wearing it during a drizzling rain storm with no problems, I gave it a much more challenging test. I continued to wear the jacket while tying down multiple kayaks to my truck's rack system under heavy rain conditions.  The most impressive part was that I was crawling around on the wet kayaks and even laying on my back putting pressure on the rain soaked kayaks/jacket and even then the water still didn't come thru the fabric.   I stayed dry and comfortable even under conditions where pressure was applied to the wet jacket's facing.  I even opened up the pit zips some to dump a little heat generated from the activity and water still didn't pass thru.   I have had many other ""waterproof"" jackets not hold up to that kind of a test.  Although I haven't tried it yet, I am confident that it will work great even while wearing a pack during a rain storm given the test I already put it thru.  Additionally, I had great freedom of movement while reaching up and around at awkward angles.  I typically wear a size large and this one was no exception.  It fits large enough that I have a decent amount of space for additional layers underneath during colder conditions.   I really like the collar on it and how it fits so comfortably with the hood up or down.  My only knock to it is that it could be quieter.   The fabric is rather noisy.  Still, I plan on taking it with me on backpacking trips where I am likely to encounter decent amounts of rain or snow.  It doesn't compress as small nor is it as light of an overall weight as another three layer gortex minimalist jacket I have, but this one has additional handy features like the pit zips and strategically placed pockets.

Over the years, I have tried several models of rain jackets from good brands like TNF, Columbia, Patagonia, etc. Let me tell you this: Today ARC'TERYX makes the best hardshells in the world. I was introduced to Arcteryx when I purchased the lighter ALPHA FL and it's performance blew my mind.

After that first experience I decided to buy the ALPHA SV. A few days ago, while having lunch at 15,420ft (4,700 mts) we were hit by a sudden storm. As soon I put the ALPHA SV on I felt like  was on a shelter. Later that same day, we got relentless hail, bittering cold winds and a heavy downpour. This jacket feels like wearing a 16th century armour. YES. It is that good. It  makes you feel invulnerale. I never felt so much confidence wearing other jackets!. Besides the weather protection, I was impressed by the fact that DWR coating showed no signs of wearing off in the hips and the shoulders area. I can not say the same about my many other rain jackets.

Other features I like are the generous hood design and the many pockets. The hood can be optimally adjusted to be worn with a helmet or without it. The two front pockets are good for storing gps, compass, maps, snacks, radio, satellite phone, gloves etc. There are two extra internal pockets. The pit zips for ventilation also come handy for cooling down! This jacket features everything you need on a big day in the countryside. Every single detail is thoughfully designed and well executed. It is a perfect jacket! I never thought I would find one!

This piece was designed to be worn under ""severe conditions"", so it has plenty of room for layering up. When static, I can wear a base layer, a R1 fleece, a Nano Air and a Ghost Whisperer underneath easily and I felt like I could still add more layers! For reference I'm 5,8 ft and I weight 154 pounds (178 cms and 70kg). I wear a SMALL, like in other Arc'teryx garments. If you don't intend to wear so many layers underneath, you can probably size down. I feel like I could use the x-small too, but it just wouldn't provide enough space for layering up.

If you're heading to the most extreme environments on earth, you live in the end of the world or if you simply valorate the best equipment and want THE MOST PROTECTIVE hardshell in the market, this garment will be a welcome addition to your arsenal. It is expensive, but it will last you many years. I wish I had bought this piece before, instead of wasting my money with cheaper jackets. I will definetely buy again rain gear from ARC'TERYX.

Started climb with puffy but nearly died of heatstroke even at -2. The ability to ventilate this jacket while you're working hard and keeping dry made climbing much more enjoyable. As I wasn't soaked while on belay I didn't freeze my ass off either.

So the jacket does exactly what it was designed for. Breathability, waterproofness, articulation, and it doesn't sneak out from under your harness. Excellent piece of gear. I bought the Lg thinking about layering and while it's fine a Med would have worked too.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-07-11 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

It's fantastic for layering, giving enough room for a decent insulator jacket underneath while still fitting decently close to the body.  No hand pockets but the breast pockets are huge and can hold a ridiculous amount of stuff.

The Magma color is pretty visible from far away through heavy snow, and if you're out skiing with friends it would be pretty hard for them to lose track of you, even though the trees.

I'm a pretty tall guy but I'm pretty thin, so I was kind of stuck between the M and L - tried both of them on and the M fits fine in the arms and down past the waistline, the L is mostly just more voluminous.

"Arc'teryx","Sidewinder SV Jacket - Men's","6329348",4,"Size:
I normally wear an XL jacket or shirt and this arcteryx jacket was no exception.

Fit:
Jacket has a great athletic style fit to it.  This jacket is notably larger than my arcteryx beta AR.  However, it is meant to be.  This is supposed to be part of a layered system.  It provides plenty of space for this.  The namesake sidewinder zipper feels very good when zipped to the top.  If you try to leave it partially unzipped it feels odd; you will find yourself trying to straighten the jacket, even though it is on straight because it doesn't feel quite right.

Function:
I have taken this on many trips but my first demonstrates it's performance.  I took this jacket to a weekend trip to Lutsen with my family in February.  During the trip we had a blizzard but were insistent on getting to the mountain.  Most of the day we were lucky if we could see 50 ft in front of us, often we couldn't even find the lift.  The snow was very large, wet, and heavy.  The snow would melt as soon as it landed on you.  Everyone in my family got soaked to the bone within an hour.  I destroyed a brand new pair of snowboarding mittens it was so bad.  This jacket kept me dry the entire day.  Near the cuffs it has a ""damp"" look which indicates the DWR had failed, however the next goretex layer held strong and no moisture went through.  The photo is in the lift from this trip.  

Quality:
The quality is outstanding.  The coat feels great. The zipper feels super solid.  I have no fear anything will fail.  If it does, it is covered by a lifetime warranty.

Cost:
I can not personally tell you if a $800 jacket is right for you.  You can get them cheaper at the end of a season.  However, this jacket is a high performer and has a lifetime warranty.  You should not NEED to buy another jacket ever again.  Really how much more technology than goretex pro will you need?

At 6 Feet, I had to get the large to have sleeves long enough, and with a 30 waist, there is a lot of room for layers underneath. (Use the sizing charts at Archteryx.com) But that's OK.

The fit is amazing too. Here's how awesome it is...

"Arc'teryx","Atom LT Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","108681443",5,"From the endless glaciers of Mount Rainier, to the massive granite faces of El Capitan, and the rugged ice clad peaks in the high Sierra the Arc'teryx Atom LT is perhaps the best insulating piece I have ever used. Its functionality is very well thought out, and with high versatility, decent durability, and high comfort it is a true workhorse in any environment. This jacket was designed with the intention of moving fast in the mountains, because of this the jacket is lightly insulated and highly breathable, but also surprisingly warm for how thin it feels. For storage, the jacket can be easily packed into its own sleeve.

Insulation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The jacket uses 60 grams of  Coreloft™ insulation. Composed of polyester, this material is durable, lightweight, dries far more quickly than down, and most importantly will still keep the user warm when wet. 

Fabric
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The outer shell of the Atom LT is composed of 20 denier nylon Tyono™ fabric on the majority of the jacket, and a polyester/elastane Polartec® Power Stretch® fabric under the arms and on the sides of the jacket. The Polartec® fabric is extremely breathable, and is quite stretchy. This gives the user better range of motion especially when reaching overhead while climbing. The Tyono™ shell material is DWR treated and is thus highly water resistant. I have walked for miles in light to medium rain in this jacket while remaining completely dry. The same material also makes the jacket exceptionally wind resistant, The interior of the jacket is the same material as the outer with the exception of the underarms which are a soft comfortable fleece. 



Comfort
-------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the greatest reasons that I love this jacket, is that it is incredibly comfortable and remains so indefinitely while moving in the mountains. Because of its superb breathability, the jacket has a massive comfortable temperature range. I have worn it from the mid sixties to the low twenties (Fahrenheit) and remained the same comfortable temperature. The hood is also climbing helmet compatible and works well both under and over a helmet. The jacket is also extremely lightweight for the warmth that it provides, and feels almost weightless as you glide across technical terrain with ease. This jacket makes the perfect mid-layer, and when paired with a good base layer and high end hard shell such as the Arc'teryx Alpha SV (review coming soon). It is perfect for almost any conditions in alpine environments weather hiking, climbing, backpacking, or skiing.



Reliability/Durability
-------------------------------------------------------------------
After 6 months of very heavy use in the mountains, the jacket is still in almost perfect condition/ The outer shell is surprisingly resilient for how thin and light it feels, and provides decent protection against abrasion. The jacket did get a small hole after getting snagged on a section of razor sharp rock while climbing in Wyoming, though this was easily repaired with a tiny Goretex patch. Other than that, one of the jacket's cuffs is starting to show signs of wear as a small hole has appeared where the cuff connects to the shell fabric. As far as reliability, this jacket has never failed me even after hundreds of hours in the mountains and in often heinous conditions; rain, snow, sleet, sand, dirt, nothing can stop this jacket from doing its job. When cared for properly and washed with an appropriate technical clothing detergent (Arc'teryx recommends Grangers, but Nikwax works just fine) the jacket remains in very good condition, and the insulation has not lost any loft whatsoever.

The design and construction of this down and Core Loft insulated coat is truly a work of art.

I use this jacket primarily for biking to/from work, sometimes for evening trail runs, and it's perfect for that. I agree with others that it's not a substitute for a rain jacket, but I was actually pleasantly surprised at how much water it sheds before it gets saturated. 

The jacket stuffs into the chest pocket, approximately 4""x6"". Not a feature I use very often, but still nice. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-24 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

It may shed a few random drops of water, but definitely NOT meant to be a rain jacket. Best as a wind layer. It packs down INCREDIBLY small. I shoved it into a small purse the other day heading into town at night so I could wear it home.

Also, if you happen to get caught in a major downpour in this jacket, you will get soaked.  However, this thing does dry out fast, and for windy days it's an awesome layer.

"Arc'teryx","Squamish Hooded Jacket - Women's","4057022",5,"Sizing reference: (Female) 5' 4.75"", 110 pounds, ~34A. 

USE: I purchased this jacket to use for running & hiking in light rain & wind in the spring/summer. In reality, I wear this jacket rain or shine. Note: this is NOT waterproof & will not keep you dry in a downpour.

FIT: I have a size SMALL. I don't like my jackets very tight, and I like to keep in mind I might want a couple thin layers underneath any jacket I have to get the most use out of them. I have broad shoulders, a fairly small cup size, and about a 34"" bust, & the chest fits perfectly--not too tight, not too loose. I have a +1 ape index & the cuffs fit just right at my wrists, & they don't slide around. The jacket fits comfortably around your face when fully zipped (see pic) & neither constrains your neck nor chafes your chin. 

PROS: It's incredibly lightweight & perfectly stretchy, and if you need a warm-weather emergency jacket on a run, walk, hike, climb, etc., stop here! When I don't need it, I can easily & quickly tie it around my waist. The single cinch cord at the bottom of the jacket as well as on the hood are effortless to use, and the light but firm functional brim makes this my go-to jacket on a cloudy day when I don't want to carry around my crunchy Gore-Tex. The chest pocket is great for carrying my phone & tiny wallet. One more thing: the silver logo is reflective! (see pic). Arc'teryx thinks of it all, which, for me, makes it worth the investment.

CONS: Use the velcro closures carefully on this jacket--they may scratch your skin. When I first got this jacket, I had a few 8-inch bright red scratches on my body from the sharpness of the edge on the closure. The edges have since softened a bit with use. Finally, the lack of side pockets drives some people mad. I am not one of those people, & on a run, I find that I simply don't need side pockets; but be aware there aren't any on this model.

Being familiar with the Gamma MX Jacket, I knew I wanted a pair of pants that had the same flexibility and durability. In combination with a trim fit, the Gamma AR Pants fit the bill. 

These pants are burly, however they are unlined, so layering them with a power-stretch bottom works great for Winter use in all but the most frigid temps. The fabric has held up to bush whacking approaches through dead fall trees and near misses with the points of my crampons. The fabric also strikes a balance between windproof and breathable making them great on the approach through the trees and exposed on the climb.

The fit of these pants is also second to none. The built in belt allows them to be worn next to skin with a quick cinch on warmer Summer Alpine Rock days. They have a trim ""athletic"" fit that still allows for freedom of movement, with or without layers underneath. So far, soooo good...

"Arc'teryx","Camosun Parka - Men's","5576788",2,"Bottom line, I really wanted to love this jacket, but the hood is terrible.
I bought this as a biking/walking jacket for the winters here in Copenhagen (only 1.5 km bike commute so not much time to build up a lot of heat). This jacket is great in so many ways. It feels very warm, fits perfectly, and looks smart enough to wear to the office. I have a medium theta AR, but took a small in this one for the more fitted  look - I can't imagine needing to layer under this one in our mild winters.

But the hood....the hood is terrible. Unlike my Arc'tyrex theta AR, this hood does not seem to have a way to tighten (aside from the two side pulls). There is a pull in the back of the hood - but this only adjust how far forward/back the hood sits on the forehead. This means that everytime I turn my head, the hood stays put, and I end up getting one eye full of the inside of my hood. I've had other lessor jackets like this and it drives me nuts.

If you end up doing anything requiring the hood, and want to be able to see out of both eyes when your turn your head, this might not be for you. If they used the same hood system as the Fission SV, this would be perfect.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-12-13 00:00:00","I returned this product before using it",""

I had looked at some of the Canada Goose parkas and similar competitors but I felt like the fur hood stood out and wasn't as discrete as I would like for client or business meetings.  I really like the small Arc'teryx symbol on the sleeve and no other markings/labels.

As for fit, I am 5'9"", 195 lbs with a 33"" waist and got a Large (I basically have the same build as Julian Edelman minus an inch and a few lbs).  I originally purchased the Medium and it actually fit really well when I had a t-shirt or a light layer on but I couldn't comfortably fit multiple layers or anything bulky like a suit or a sweater under it so I returned the Medium for a Large. 

I've had it for about a year now and it works exactly as I was expecting.  It's very warm but not to the point where I worry about over heating.  Water rolls off it without any issues.  It blocks 100% of the wind and I love that the cuffs are longer on the the back of your hand vs the palm.  Arc'Teryx makes bombproof stuff and this parka is no exception.  I'd highly recommend it.

If you're like me and it feels like you're looking for a jacket that may not exist, then take note: I wanted a Parka that was as warm as my best 800 fill technical puffy, waterproof and breathable, but looked like I bought it primarily cause it looked great with business casual to semi formal. You can find pieces of the afore described perfect jacket from NorthFace, Patagonia, Marmott, but not the whole Monty. Waterproof with synthetic down (never as warm or comfy no matter how much they use) or possibly 650 down fill (why must you skimp) but even then the style was usually wanting. Burton makes 2 jackets with 800 fill down and Gore-tex shell, but one was a standard parka with the ugly feaux fur, and looked like a standard LL Bean coat, the other was great but it totally looked like a snowboard jacket, which it was. Close but no cigar.

I took a look at the Camosun because I never see Arc'teryx on sale, but the Camosun was on sale for exactly 3 days on Backcountry.com, and after hours of searching reviews for one person to say that it really wasn't all that warm...not one review used those sentiments, quite the opposite in fact.The sizing: I am 5'9 and 172lbs and can take a large in most jackets or a medium if they run slightly big.  The medium fits perfect. I was a little concerned because most people say the jacket runs large, and the 6'1 model that weighs 180 was wearing a medium and it looked like it was all the way down to his wrists. Plus others reviews who were my height but 150 lbs and below said they had to go with the small. The medium fits me perfect, not long on the arms, perhaps because my shoulders are broad for my size. It has an athletic cut so its slightly form fitting which adds to the warmth trapping but perfect room for layering if you get the right size for you. The warmth: I read reviews raving about how super warm this jacket was to be such a lightweight. However, at 2lbs 3 oz, this jacket is on the light side of parkas but calling it lightweight is misleading. It feels super substantial and although the Burton AK L2 LZ Down jacket had 800 fill and felt slightly puffier and overall heavier, there is obviously something to the down mapping that Arc'teryx touts because this coat traps the heat like nothing I've felt before. Would I love for Arc'teryx to go all the way with this jacket and go with their 850 fill instead of the current 750? Absolutely, and I would without hesitation pay another $100 for that, but hey Arc'teryx isn't lying when they say its one of the warmest pieces they make. I haven't had it long enough to give temperature ratings but based on my initial wearing, I'm thinking I'll be fine with a short sleeve polo down to 20 F or lower before layering and I run naturally cold. I was able to find the total volume of down in my quest for information on its warmth, its 105 grams, and that's total grams not g/meter squared. The product expert at Arc'teryx said the Therme Parka has 120 grams and is a little warmer. Perhaps because its a little longer? If there's no reason then why did they supposedly improve on this product from the Therme Parka and make it less plush/warm? In conclusion, the Camosun looks incredible with jeans to business attire, even the embroidered symbol on the left shoulder looks classy. Its warmth is second to none of any jacket I've ever experienced, outside of a high end expedition type Parka.  As others have said it has a standard oversized hood that I'm guessing could fit over a helmet should you ever need it, wish they would develop an urban hood that was smaller. The hood uses coreloft as the head is prone to sweat and it retains heat when wet, but as an urban piece I'd prefer true down and a bit more insulation in the hood.  BUT, other than those small wish items this jacket is PERFECT!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-11-27 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Arc'teryx","Camosun Parka - Men's","108458529",4,"Just got it yesterday and worn it twice, will share my initial impression and update later on.

Things I liked:
- It's light. Like you wouldn't believe how light. In terms of weight, not warmth.
- The color is dark rich blue, I'd call it dark navy, but I'm a guy, thus a very limited range of color names.
- Seams on the outer shell are virtually non-existent. So thin that with a lighting in my apartment I couldn't even spot them at first and had to look closely to find them.
- Zipper feels heavy and reliable as well as the entire zipping area. The flap on the inside is tough and rigid, the way you want it. 
- Outer pockets are perfect size for the sleeve to go in and there is almost no gap left, so your hands are completely sealed off. You can see it was designed with this in mind.

Things I didn't like:
- It bulks around the waist and, unlike on the pictures, there is no waist line. It looks like I have a beer belly, which I don't.
- Hood design is ridiculous. It is literally designed like a box of near cubic shape and there is no point to all that extra room, no head is shaped like this or sized like this.
- Hood adjustments. The back puller barely works and sucks itself back in. I might have a faulty fixer-holder thingy, idk. I got the hang of the side pullers and they do improve the shape and size of the hood, but it still does not look nearly as neat as a casual jacket requires. And relaxing side pullers takes more time and effort than I would like.
- Inside pocket zipper slider is ver small. I have to pinch it with the tips of my fingers to pull it and I have extremely normal size hands. Having a piece of garment like on the front zipper or just a bigger slider would help.
- I can't imagine zipping outside pockets on any occasion and I'm afraid that having zipper there might scratch up the sleeves when I put them in. I believe a magnet or a flap would have been a better solution.

Things I didn't expect:
- It does make a noize, but since the jacket is so light thats the only thing that reminds you you are wearing it at all.
- The neck is much wider than I expected. I've read a lot of reviews saying it's too tight. It's not and you really need a scarf or a gater to fill the space. In terms of width I can easily lower my head up to my nose into the neck.
- The neck doesn't make a noise or gets stuck against the chin, but that might be due to Movember providing an additional layer. 

Summary:
It is a solid jacket, superb craftsmanship, and I expect it to stand well to the elements. However, I'm dissappointed in how little thought went into the features. Yes, it has trademark Arc'teryx technology and quality that is universal across other Arc'teryx jackets, but it feels like no further thought went into making it a true urban jacket. I feel like quite a few things could have been improved at almost no cost.

Edit:
- Had a chance to test it out on a couple of chill rainy days. It does a beautiful job. Water beads up into tiny drops that could be easily shaken off.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-11-16 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

Update: ok, I have had this jacket now through the winter season. Love love love this jacket. I wear it everyday to work, it keeps me completely dry when it's raining and in the 40's, and completely warm and dry when it's snowing. The pockets are great. Everyday I stuff my George sized wallet, keeys, gloves, and cell phone in the front pocket, they are deep and roomy. I do still feel a little draft when I only have a button down underneath and it's below 20, but I have room to layer and with layers the draft is no issue. Even though I usually wear it to work, it does great out on a little trail walk. Wore it today in heavy snow and it stayed warm and dry the whole time. I still don't particularly like the hood.

"Arc'teryx","Atom AR Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","106789520",5,"My AR just came today. I will update my review after I take it to the mountains in the coming months. However, this sale prompted me to buy this jacket, and I imagine other people are looking at it too.

My initial impressions are positive. The medium fits my build well. I was on the fence about ordering a small or medium. For reference, I have a 100 weight mountain hardware fleece pull over and a size small marmot minimalist shell. I also have an older north face Denali fleece in a size small. 

Anyways, my vision with this jacket is to be able to layer it with the 100 weight and or a light down vest in ultra cold conditions. Because of my interest in layering it and my broader shoulders I went for the medium. Layered with the marmot shell, the jacket fits well. The tail/ bottom of the jacket sticks out maybe a half inch below the shell, but not an awkward amount. 

Just putting the jacket on in the house lead me to being almost immediately too warm.  

As a follow up, I just took this jacket to the Sierras in the middle of April, and I am still impressed. The jacket kept me comfortable in camp as the sun went down at 11,000 ft.

"Arc'teryx","Atom AR Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","5271120",4,"Overall this jacket is great. I can wear it pretty much in any temperature ranging from 45 and below.  If you get to the extreme temperature 10 degrees or below, I would suggest having a hard shell over it block the wind better or having a warm fleece or thermal underneath. Also, I would advise using a hard shell if the weather is sloppy out (rain, sleet, snow). The DWR works great but I wouldn't want to chance wetting out the jacket. 

The best three features have to be 1. the hood (put a beanie on with the hood and your head remains toasty for days) 2. the pockets (they all work great and functional esp the hand warmer pockets) 3. the high collar (perfect protection to keep your neck warm if you forget the scarf).

The only downside is breathability. It doesn't vent well. So if you are skiing, snowboarding, shoveling, etc; this jacket isn't going to perform as well as the LT version. But if you are using this jacket for belaying, commuting, standing around in the cold weather, it will perform admirably.

The Arc'teryx Atom AR features 120g of coreloft insulation in the body, 80g under the arms and 60g in the hood.  Compare that to the Atom LT (lightweight) at 60g in the body.  The AR is a whole lot warmer than the LT, and breathes surprisingly well for having synthetic insulation.

"Arc'teryx","Atom AR Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","107310645",5,"So I was having quite the issue in purchasing a winter jacket this year.  I received $$ to buy a new jacket and wanted something very warm.  Long story short, after researching, educating myself on the differences between insulated, soft/hard shells, triclimates, etc., visiting numerous stores and checking myriad online sites, I finally decided on this beautiful jacket.  

I was hesitant that it really would be that ""warm jacket"" to withstand the Chicagoland winters (or even Wisconsin or Minnesota which I frequently visit in winter).  

After opening the package from Backcountry, I was thinking, ""is this it?"" as it seemed too light and would not be warm enough.  As iterated above, it is light yet very warm.  I have worn it in 40 degrees down to single digits so far and have been comfortable, including damp weather (much moisture in this area in the winter).  When it is very windy, I can see having a shell to defray this would be beneficial, but in due time.  So far it has been very impressive and comfortable.  I read this all over and this is a common theme in comments - that the jacket is deceivingly warm given its' light weight.  

It is bulky a bit and admittedly I am an odd size - I usually wear medium shirts these days as I dislike wearing a large given my stature (sorta tall, thin, not broad shoulders and I have skinny wrists).  The medium (see below) was a tad too tight, although this is the style of the jacket (""athletic fit"") and after buying the large, I second guessed my decision and wanted to try on the medium.  Backcountry/my gearhead Justin were amazingly accomodating.  They are surely a company I will do business with again as he had a medium sent to my home and told me just to send back whichever I didn't want.

I am just under 6"" and am 185 lbs.  The large works and the reason I am going with the large is because if I want to layer warm sweaters/fleece underneath in the future, I want to be able to not be too constricted (it felt this may be the case).  The sleeves are a bit long on the large for me and loose on the wrists just a bit (but that is because I don't have the largest wrists as mentioned).  The issue with the medium, however, is that since I'm tall for a medium, it comes up a bit short on the waist vs the large which is noticeably different.

At any rate, I am so satisfied with the quality of this jacket in the comfort, the warmth, the style and the attention to detail (stitching, zippers and features), I am trying to decide on if I want the SL or the LT for warmer weather.  I have tried on the LT and it is very comfortable and will go with medium on that.

I also will be getting a shell next winter; there is no doubt that I will go with Backcountry for future purchases.  Very impressed all around.  ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-03-06 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Arc'teryx","Atom AR Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","3902045",1,"I actually had to buy this jacket from 3 different online retailers and send it back for a refund every time; since every single one had stitching defects!

In the cuff area where the stretchy material is joined with the Tyono denier in a delta/triangular-shape, the stitching was either sloppy, skewed or simply defective, which resulted in the images attached to this review. 
(The last image is from my climbing partner's jacket, which is well stitched in comparison!)

When you get a garment like this you don't even want to dare imagine what will happen while climbing a difficult wall or while reaching for an ice screw on your harness; âwith puffy deformed sleeves due to manufacturing blunders of the like ... snagging or catching onto something is easily possible.

Admittedly, the area and the materials perhaps are difficult to control during the stitching process, but at this price tag I think one is entitled to expect more from Arc'teryx.

Actually, I contacted customer service and got a template answer in return 2 weeks later, which made evident the company's policy and forthcoming after-sales care. If it hadn't been for this blunder and quite frankly indifference, perhaps I would have continued putting faith in Arc'teryx products, since the few I still have are of excellent manufacturing and quality control. Then again, they are not Made-in-Bangladesh ...

"Arc'teryx","Atom AR Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","105490641",5,"Wanted a super warm mid-layer for winter hiking and ice climbing in the -20 to +10 degree Fahrenheit days in New Hampshire and Vermot. I could alternatively layer 2 med-light weight  puffy jackets, but that turns me into a marshmallow beneath my shell and reduces mobility. I also wanted a light weight and warm jacket for rock climbing during 40 degree late fall days. I also wanted a jacket that would keep me warm while standing still waiting for the bus or train. 

I own the Arc'teryx Nuclei LT, and that's a great mid layer, but I wanted something warmer without the price of the Nuclei AR.

Fit:
I bought a medium. Fits great. I'm 5'9"" 170lbs, 32 inch arm length, 41-42 inch chest, 31 inch waist, athletic wrestlers build. Just enough space for a fleece and a base layer to comfortably fit. Barely compact enough to layer under a medium Arc'teryx Alpha FL without being squeezed.

Warmth:
Warm! It may be a bit too warm as a midlayer in anything but the coldest temps, but I haven't yet tested it. It will allow me to give my belay jacket a rest during low activity intervals. Perfect weight for staying warm in the city.

Appearance/feel
The face fabric, for a puffy, feels bomber. No sheen, but the reflective product label. Doesn't make me look like the stayed puff marshmellow man. Hand warmer pockets are felt lined and feel marvelous. As with most Arc'teryx products, fit, finish, and style are extremely well done. I perfect for going about town.

Functionality 
Great range of motion. Doesn't lift much with arms raised above, so it shouldn't pull out from a harness while climbing. The hood has a single adjustment in back and it allows the hood to stay put with and without a helmet. My Mammut Rock Rider helmet, one of the bulky polystyrene types, fits well underneath, but just barely - the shoulders hardly lift up when glancing down,  but the back of the jacket pulls up ever so slightly. Doubt this would happen with a smaller, plastic shell helmet like the Half Dome.

For my needs this is a great jacket. My only complaint is that the jacket lacks a stuff compression sack and does not stuff into its own pocket. I'll have to find a compression sack that works for clipping this to my harness.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-12-10 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

The fit is perfect, not too slim or too long.  Interesting the square pattern is on the outside.  It is very light and takes up very little room stuff in my backpack. 

First real test was a 10 mile hike out to Tomales Point and back.  Started early  in the morning.  As temps went from cool to hot for a moment I thought about taking it off, but it was actually fine so I just unzipped it and kept cruising along.  The forecast was for strong winds later in the day and boy was that a spot on prediction.  Cold gusts off the Pacific, up to 50 mph, it was hard to stand at times.  Most people passing us had full parkas zipped with hoods synch'd down.  I just had this on and never felt like I needed to break out my shell.  I was amazed how it functioned as temps must have fluctuated 30-40 degrees during the day.

"Arc'teryx","Squamish Hooded Jacket - Men's","5020009",5,"Let me say at the outset: I'm an Arcteryx whore.  Totally acknowledge it.  I'd spend all day in my Alpha SV, in just about any conditions, and do it happily.  But there are times when the skies are clear and you're ready to head out, and you're not really sure that you need to pack such a bomber jacket...when you want something light to throw in your pack as insurance against bad weather.  You've done enough hiking/skiing/biking to know that if things turn bad, you want a product that will work to keep you dry and warm.

My previous experience with lightweight and ""ghost"" jackets was that they were light and packable, and some were even waterproof, but when you needed them, they were not breathable or durable.  They were bandaids that helped keep you dry from rainfall, but that built up sweat inside like a proverbial sauna.

The Squamish is a pleasant surprise.  It's inexpensive (for Arcteryx standards), light and packable--all good qualities in a 'just in case' jacket.  but when you need it, it's waterproof, reasonably windproof, and breathable.  I'm surprised by how effective a nylon/DWR system can be.  20 years ago, when Goretex was too expensive to afford, the nylon/""waterproof coating"" jackets were good for a little rain, and then would get saturated and you'd get wet.  Not so with the squamish.  It's waterproof.  I have had it in some tough conditions, and it doesn't soak through.  

Moreover, unlike most ghost jackets, it is breathable enough to actually be useable as a frontline jacket.  I find myself wearing it from time to time when I don't need the weight of the Alpha SV, but when I do need reliable, breathable, waterproof jackets.  Don't tell Arcteryx, but making good, inexpensive jackets like this undermines the need for their more expensive products, in many 'normal' circumstances.  (I'm still not giving up my Alpha).  Great jacket!  Arcteryx-true sizing, which means it is an athletic cut.  I'm 6', 155#, and a medium is perfect.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-12-17 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

Pros/Cons: 
+Fits my frame and long arms very well. Went with a Medium. I was stuck between this and the Patagonia Houdini. Chose this because the material, design and fit seems more versatile. I also felt the Houdini was off in regard to torso:shoulder size. Medium was too tight in the chest and short in the arms and Large was way too baggy. 
+Packability and weight are competitive with others in its class. I can easily stow this in my Ultraspire vest with my other essentials and head out on a long trail excursion.
+ Not as ""technical"" looking as other wind jackets. I often wear it to work (opted for the neutral iron anvil color) without looking like I'm going out for exercise.
+Breathes better than the Houdini (had one and sold it due to poor fit and breathability).
+ Zipper is super easy and glides effortlessly with one hand. 
+ Elastic, hook-and-loop cuffs and hem drawcord work great and are much appreciated when the weather calls for them.
+Hood is not oversized and fits perfect.
- Price is steep and was a hard pill to swallow...but so glad I did.

                                                                                   The fit is a little strange, as other have pointed out.  I'm about 5'10, 160lbs, usually wear a 32x30 pant size, and got the small.  It fits snugly in the waist over my jeans, with a little stretch from the elastic in the waist.  I'm actually really happy with how they fit in the waist, seat, and thighs.  Very slim, not a lot of extra fabric or bagginess.  The closure system for the waist works well, and is less goofy and more low-profile than having plastic buckles on the front, like some of Arcteryx's other pants.


From the knee down to the ankle though, they are pretty baggy.  I'm used to wearing skinny jeans, and I knew they wouldn't fit that slim, but there's really a lot of extra material around the ankle that doesn't need to be there for any reason, except for those hikers that feel self-conscious wearing tighter clothing.  Seriously, this is supposed to be Arcteryx's lightest, fastest, most trim-fitting pants, and there's probably an ounce of material they could get rid of here, and at the same time keep me from catching the pants in my chain when riding my bike or dragging on the floor when I walk, which brings me to my next quibble...


They are way too long.  For someone wearing a small pant, I feel like I'm hardly on the short side, but these are about an inch or so longer than I would have expected them to be, maybe more like two.  I know there's a short version, but it wasn't available when I bought these, and I didn't want to risk getting the short and having it be too short.  The pants seem made for someone who is a 6ft+ beanpole, which is what the tall sizes are for, right?


Performance-wise though, they are excellent.  The fabric feels VERY durable, much more so than the Alpha SL and Beta SL jackets I own, and the extra-durable parts in the ankle are really nice.  The pants repel water well, and even after wetting out, nothing gets through.  I'm very pleased with these as far as waterproofing, and that's why they'll get 4-stars, they do what they advertise.


They do tend to get hot, like any waterproof layer, but a little sweat is better than a lot of water, so they're worth it.  Typical Arcteryx build quality and performance, just not the fit I was hoping for.


I had considered getting the Beta AR pants as well, for the extra durability, but after seeing those in-person, they were VERY heavy, definitely more of a winter-use product with gaiters and more features.

Other than the poor fit, the garment seems quite nice. The pant looks and feels great in terms of build quality. However, the waist adjustment system is not as nice as others I've seen.

"Arc'teryx","Alpha SL Gore-Tex Pant - Men's","1100588490",5,"   Before writing this review, I tried to think of something negative about these pants. Honestly, I can't think of anything I would change about them.
   Let's just say this: I recently spent 7 hours hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park in a constantly rotating storm of rain, sleet, hail and snow. Then snow, hail, sleet and rain. Then combinations of rain & sleet, hail and rain, sleet and snow. You get the idea: all the cold, wind and wet the Rocky Mountains can dish up. During the entire hike, I was never wet from the storm nor wet from sweat. Typical of Arc'teryx gear, the cut is trim but plenty of room in the knees and rear for hiking, scrambling,  etc. 
   They are lightweight and very packable. They are a  natural for your 10 essentials and will fit in any pack.   I am 5' 11"", 170 pounds, 34"" waist and 32"" length; the medium/reg fit like they were tailored for me. 
   Some may object to the lack of pockets. But you don't need the added weight (& cost) when you consider your hiking pants underneath have pockets as does your rain coat. Speaking of price, you get what you pay for. Arc'teryx price = Arc'teryx quality. I should have bought these last year. Don't make that mistake. Get 'em. Wear 'em.

I threw these on  when it started raining on a winter route and I didn't have to worry about my crampons tearing a hole into my expensive pants. The full zip design is simply the best when it comes to mountaineering hardshell pants. The boot hooks and hem cinch are awesome. I didn't even use gaiters when hiking through the snow; its that good. Also, they're totally waterproof (it is Goretex) with a great DWR coating to bead off the water. 

These pants are made from gore paclite, but the face fabric is plenty burly. The paclite makes them super light weight so I have used these pants just as rain pants as well. They breathe very well but I wouldn't want the inner fabric in direct contact with my skin. Be sure to wear long-underwear under the pants if you use them as rain pants. 

As a reference, I'm 6' with a 32"" inseam and very skinny. The small actually fit great and gives me enough length in the legs. I think the sizing guide is off on all Arc'teryx hardhsell pants though... they seem to run a little longer than suggested by their size charts.

"Arc'teryx","Phase SL Boxer - Men's","4091453",4,"I have had these for about a year.  I have 2 pair and wear them as often as I can, especially in the summer.  The material is like no other.  It is so light and soft.  I can literally see my hand through the material it is so thin, but yet they seem very durable.  The material looks as good as the day I bought them.  Moisture wicking is fantastic, and it is the only underwear I have tried that keeps me dry even on those hot summer days.  I have a pair of ExOfficio, but I haven't had the chance to test these out in the same conditions, so they may be as good.  The ExOfficio material is definitely thicker and not as comfortable probably due to the texture.  I also like the thinner waist band on these, and I haven't had any issues with it rolling or folding over.  Although the waist band doesn't feel nearly as nice as the rest of the material.  Last but not least, they cradle the goods very well, and everything feels nice and supportive without being squished.  I can't imagine a better fit in this regard. 

My only complaints are the price, and the material tends to loosen around the leg until they are washed again.  I am 5'10"", 160lbs with a 32"" waist, and I have the medium.  I wish they were a little snugger around the leg even straight out of the washer.  Arc'teryx calls it a boxer, but the fit is really somewhere inbetween a boxer and a boxer-brief for me.  A person would need some seriously large quads to fill these out.  Compared to the ExOfficio boxer-brief, I like the fit in the butt and crotch better on the Arc'teryx, but the ExOfficio definitely fit nicer in the legs if you prefer the legs to have a snug fit.

As good as these are, it's really hard to justify paying $45 for a pair of underwear, especially if they are not perfect.  I would give these 5/5 if Arc'teryx would fix the leg stretch issue and drop the price $10.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2013-05-31 00:00:00","",""

I'm pretty tall, at 6'5"", long arms, and broader shoulders than hips. I tend to hike at a pretty fast pace, and in the humid Northeast. I didn't expect this shirt to be useful in the summer, but thought i'd give it a shot for the spring and fall seasons.

It does breath pretty well. I've been out a few times now in 50 degree weather. Being able to button down a bit, and roll up sleeves. All good. However, at some point, the material becomes saturated; at this point, it's not especially comfortable. The Norrona/29  Tech shirt has a similar problem. Once it wets out, ugh. In contrast, the Fjallraven Abisko vent zip-down feels pretty good, even saturated. This Elaho does dry very fast, as does the Abisko vent zip-down (the Norrona Tech shirt takes forever to dry).

Fit-wise, it's not great for me. I know, 6'5"" and not burly means I'm always going to be in a bit of a no-mans land viz. fit. (Backcountry, are you reading? How about a series focused on tall dudes?). However, this one goes a bit off the normal Arc'teryx fit. I have other button downs from them, also in Large, and don't have this problem that the Elaho does: the shoulders are too narrow, and the hips are WAY too wide. It's almost ridiculous. Though the arms are almost fine (i could use another 1-2"", but it's passable). But the narrow shoulders mean that any motion results in restriction and ride-up of the sleeves.

At the hips... omg, I must have a good 8"" of excess material. Perhaps this was intentional, to allow for venting? It's clearly not what is illustrated in their copy. Maybe I just got a dud cut.

Lastly, I got the Magnet color. It shows salt stains, from sweat, readily. I suppose this is a testament to just how quickly the material dries. But it's not very appealing, and means I feel like I need to wash it after every use, even if, stink-wise, I wouldn't otherwise have to.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-15 00:00:00","",""

"Arc'teryx","Gamma MX Softshell Jacket - Men's","3820935",5,"I'll review both the Gamma MX and the Epsilon LT, which I considered and ordered, and why I kept the Gamma.

I was looking for basically a more fleece-like jacket, with the added benefit of some wind resistance and a smooth face fabric to resist stains and pilling.  Use for bike commuting in dry, cold weather, and as a casual piece during the fall/winter.

I initially considered the Gamma MX, Epsilon LT, and the Gamma LT, all of which seem somewhat similar.  I eliminated the Gamma LT as it seemed closer to a shell from what I could tell, and lacked a nice inner fleece fabric, which is a must, as I plan to wear it over just a t-shirt and want a nice fabric on my skin.  Aesthetically, I didn't like the Arc'teryx logo on the back of the Gamma LT neck either.

So I ordered the Epsilon LT and the Gamma MX.  My impressions:

Fit:  Fit is about the same, the Epsilon seems just a tad longer and slimmer, while the Gamma MX is a bit boxier it feels.  Perhaps this is because the fabric on the Epsilon is quite a bit stiffer.  Overall, size M for me, 5' 10, 160lbs, was just about perfect, and consistent with Arcteryx sizing.  

Fabric: Both are so good, but different.  The Epsilon is classified in some places as a ""hard-fleece"" which I figured would be more fleece-like than a softshell, assuming the continuum from fleece to shell goes from soft to hard, comfortable to stiff.  Not so.  The Epsilon is quite a bit more rigid, and doesn't fold and flex like the Gamma MX.  It's not bad, it's just not what I wanted.  If you're looking for a more handsome jacket to maybe wear business casual, the Epsilon definitely looks better because of that rigidity, and it feels tough as nails, it's really a cool fabric.  On the other hand, the Gamma MX is very soft, supple, and lightweight, and I like the way it moves with me much more.  It's a lot more comfortable, but feels a little less robust.

Features:  Both are great.  I'm not a fan of the contrasting color of the bicep pocket on either jacket.  Zippers are nice, pockets are large on both.  The chest pockets on the Gamma look nice and are roomy, but I don't plan on using them for much.  There's a really nice storm-flap on the Gamma, coated in some sort of rubberized plastic, and it's nice.  The zipper is nicer on the Gamma.  And the SLEEVE CUFFS.  This, in the end, was the make or break feature for me.  The Epsilon LT cuffs are really annoying.  They're too big, so you get the sleeves coming down over your hands all the time.  Maybe that's nice if you're wearing a base layer or a shirt with cuffs on it, but the Gamma MX cuffs are perfect size, and keep the sleeves from coming too far down.  While wearing the Epsilon, I found myself constantly annoyed with the cuffs in my way.  The Gamma cuffs are perfect, I never think about them at all.

I can't comment too much on performance comparisons, because I didn't test the Epsilon before returning.  However, the Gamma is great as far as breathability and windproofness.  It feels lighter than you'd expect, but in 45 degrees, riding 30mph on a bike, it blocked 90+ % of the wind coming through, and didn't get all clammy.  That's much better than any other softshell I've ever used, including Polartec PowerShield and a Marmot ROM.  It's expensive, but it works well.

In the end, both jackets are fantastic, and I would expect the Epsilon to perform similarly to the Gamma MX as far as breathability and windproofness.  But the cuffs on the Gamma MX are what sealed the deal for me, as petty as that sounds.  Maybe that should give some insight as to how similar these jackets feel in form and function.

I was in a cave a little over a foot white and was sliding through it wearing this jacket. I thought it would surely show signs of the scraping in the cave but nope, it withstood all the abrasion with no problem. Another thing I love is just how versatile it is, it can be worn as a stand alone piece in moderately cool weather, it can be a layering piece, and it also has enough room for more layers underneath. When spring skiing i wear this and another layer underneath and am completely warm. It is advertised as water resistant which it is, but it really takes alot for it to give, and it is also fully windproof. 

Pros: Versatile, Comfortable, Great weatherproofing, light/packable, stylish, decently warm.

"Arc'teryx","Gamma MX Softshell Jacket - Men's","1207255",4,"I bought this to replace my 2nd Gamma MX since I got a screaming deal.  I am sold on the concept of this jacket and use it as a light shoulder season jacket on it's own and a layering  or high exertion piece in the winter.  I rarely use sweaters, fleeces anymore since buying the MX.  Between a short sleeve or long sleeve base layer, the MX, and a shell in various combinations I'm set for 85%+ of the conditions in CO.  I swap out the MX for an insulating layer only when it really gets really cold.

That said - I don't like the new Fortius material nearly as much as the old.  The face isn't as slippery (read harder to use for layering) and it feels warmer, but not in a good way.  Where it used to be a perfect for 35-60F depending on level of activity, it now feels too warm at the higher half even as a casual piece.

I also don't like that they relaxed the fit of the XL.  Now too roomy in the arms and gut even for a big guy.  It is much less athletic.  I'm a big fan of Arc for not assuming that all XL guys are fat arses like NF does, but they headed in that direction in this version of the Gamma MX.

I was looking for the perfect winter coat for years- something with 100% down and a strong waterproof outter shell. I got tired of buying multiple layers and finally decided to invest the money on this arcteryx beauty. I walk to work so having good gear is essential to my health and happiness. I can throw this coat on with only a t-shirt underneath and still maintain a great temperature. It's not only efficient but time saving. I no longer have to search for layers in the morning or peel them off when I get to work. The fit is sleek and not the slightest bit bulky. The coat tapers near the waist ever so slightly for a slimming look as well. The length helps to trap in heat and block out any wind.

 That being said, I decided to return the jacket, mainly because of the fit.  This coat has a relaxed fit, which is pretty different from the usual Arc'teryx fit. I usually wear a large and it fits just right, but I felt like I was swimming in the large of this coat. Although the fit was pretty flattering, I felt like it was just too much coat. And sadly, when I went down to a medium, it was just a touch too small to be really comfortable or allow for any layering under it at all (although it looked fabulous).

"Arc'teryx","Atom SL Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","106312630",5,"I spent about two weeks deliberating what lightly insulated jacket I should get for my husband for Christmas. I waffled between jackets for what felt like forever, but I always kept coming back to this one. So, this is what he ended up with and since there's powder to be had, I figured he should end up with the jacket early. This is his feedback:

""I'm a pretty small person but I run warm on the skin track, and until I figured that out about myself and my physiology I was having a helluva time trying to figure out my layering system.

Last season, on the coldest days I was trying to wear my Atom LT-- and it was nice from the car for about the first 4 minutes and then I was sweating bullets. Eventually I just realized that it's best to start cold and wear gloves because my core would warm up pretty quickly. Then the Nano Air came out and I thought that was the solution to my problem but it wasn't (still too much insulation for touring-- at least on the ascent). Then I fell in love with wearing a vest of equivalent insulation because I wouldn't have to take it off at any point in the day. However, then my arms were totally exposed to the elements and I'd often end up with numb arms, which is less than pleasant.

But....after much debate over lightly insulated mid layers my wife and I landed on the Atom SL because there's almost no insulation anywhere other than the front and back torso. The arms feature a mesh-lining that wicks away moisture, making it ideal for aerobic activities. And the side panels run from the length of your wrist to the hem and they consists of a stretchy breathable material that allows your pits to dump excess heat. Meanwhile, the exterior fabric is definitely mobility oriented, and sheds water and wind really well.

So far this season it's still been a little warm for me to wear this layer the whole day, but it also packs down small enough to not be a burden, making it great for on-the-fly protection and warmth. I intend to use this layer as my cold weather mid layer, paired with a thin long sleeve merino baselayer. Honestly, I don't think this layer could be beat-- especially in wet/windy areas like New England or the PNW. 

Bottom line: if you're familiar with the nuances of layering and full on midweight jackets were always a little bit much for you, give this layer a whirl. And to boot, I know it's going to be a major asset to my summer camping/hiking setup as well as my cold weather running layers.

As far as sizing goes-- if you're somewhere between sizes, don't hesitate to size up. I'm a small in most things, but I got the medium, because I remember Arc'teryx jackets traditionally being pretty short in the torso. The medium works totally fine but the small would have worked really well too-- it's not as short as I thought it was going to be. Either way, I'm happy.

And least importantly, but worth mentioning-- I'm pretty pale and super blonde, so yellow colorways rarely look good on me. However, the Bourbon looks awesome when I wear it casually and doesn't make me look like a washed out and washed up goober- so, so far this thing has yet to let me down and yet to be taken off.""","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-16 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

Well, fist off, because that's what it was designed for. More importantly, the Atom SL is a perfect insulated jacket for Summer because it only has a tiny amount of insulation in the body, and none in the arms - it has stretchy fleece vent panels on the side that increase venting, and a soft taffeta interior liner. I have found myself grabbing this almost every morning, and most nights so far this summer, as it's just the right amount of jacket for temps in the 50s and 60s F. I wear it around town and have also worn it on a couple early morning mountain bike rides so far this season, and it has been excellent.","EMPLOYEE","2016-06-27 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Arc'teryx","Atom SL Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","2048086160",5,"This jacket is a great addition to the Atom family, and really rounds the group out. My favorite insulating layer has been the Atom LT for some time now, due to its comfort and versatility. The Atom AR is also great, but I have given the LT the edge, because it is more capable of being used as an active piece, thanks to the fleece underarm panelling that dumps excess heat really effectively. The SL takes the active capabilities of the LT and extends them significantly. Granted, you do lose a little of the versatility to be had with the LT, as I would not recommend using the SL as an all-around cool weather jacket. However, if you are looking for a lightweight insulating layer for cold weather activities, the Atom SL fits the bill perfectly. 

As for fit, I consider it true to size, but it is important to mind the fact that this is a trim cut. It is intended to be used for active use, so it is not really a casual-wear type of cut. If you tend to straddle two sizes, it might be best to go with the upper end. 

In sum, if you are looking for a warm jacket for all-around casual use in the winter, this is not it - you want the AR. If you want a jacket that is an ultimate generalist, that can do the above, as well as a bit of active use, then the Atom LT is probably what you want. If you want a dedicated light-weight insulating active piece, then the Atom SL is perfect.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-04-01 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

I've also enjoyed the non-insulated hood.  It offers protection from the wind but breathes well enough that I don't overheat when hiking with the hood deployed.

The No Slip Zip helps mitigate zipper creep, but I'm still able to open the zipper easily with one hand.

It's based on the Trim fit block, same as the Atom LT.  The trim fit block works well if you're going to use this as a mid layer and need to wear a hard shell.

"Arc'teryx","Acrux FL Approach Shoe - Men's","1211525",4,"WHO: I live in the Southeast of the US with relatively mild winters. I’m about an hour's drive from the Mountains. I’m kind of a gear-head and have more shoes than I need in my rotation (as of now I have 9 pair that fall in between a trail runner/Approach shoe/hiking boot). I’m normally size 8.5 in running shoe but I typically go up to 9 in hiking boots, I’m a 9 in this one. I’ve had this pair just over half a year now.

WHAT: In a word, technical. FL = FAST & LIGHT, and they call it an approach shoe but it wears more like a boot and I’ve only used it as a light hiker. The durable upper paired with the hiking treads make for a great combo, then add in the super sticky Vibram® rubber outsoles and this is the grippiest shoe I own.

WHEN: This isn’t my go-to shoe for every hike. For me, it’s going to be based on the specific trail and the conditions. I can wear this is shoe year round. It’s not too hot for the summer if the trail calls for something technical and it never gets so cold in the winter that I need something more. 

WHERE: When hiking, I usually save these for more technical trails or if the rocks will be slick with water or ice. But let’s be honest I wear these shoes way more around town than I do on the trail. 

WHY: Because this shoe is just COOL. I love great design. All the new features work really well. 

STYLE: I love its look more than anything. FYI, My wife does not feel the same way. But to me, the shoe just looks like it means business. I honestly look for opportunities to wear these out.

FUNCTION: Yes everything about this shoe works great, BUT there are a few things you should know. 1. You have to double knot the laces. 2. This shoe is not perfect right out of the box, the upper is very stiff and the area just over your toes requires a good breaking-in period. After that you are good, these fit and feel great even after hours of hiking.

The two best things about this shoe are the super grippy outsole and its unique looks which pay off in the functionality. But it's clunky boot-like ride knocks it down a bit. I do love this shoe but I find myself leaving them behind when the trail calls for something faster and more responsive.

Acrux FL vs Acrux FL GXT
To Gore-Tex or not to Gore-Tex, that is the question. GXT in a shoe like this is always nice, but where I live is not necessary most of the time and the summers are so hot you don’t want it. My hiking boots are Gore-Tex so I opted for the quicker drying and slightly cooler non GXT option.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-15 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

After wearing the Arakys for shorter approaches and experiencing the same issues with the buckle and loose toe box (definitely not up for the bouldering the description touts), despite the clear upsides and comfort, I picked up the Acrux for more serious wear. After wearing them for cold approaches in Wisconsin, and a week in Sedona, this shoe is a 5 star product. Fits true to size, dries famously, and the integrated sock liner is truly innovative. I found the purchase on slick rock second to none, and ended up successfully toe camming on some impromptu crack Boulder problems and was throughly impressed. The only criticism so far is that the heel liner might dig in, so wear a high sock while breaking in.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-01 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Arc'teryx","Acrux FL Approach Shoe - Men's","4568354",5,"So originally I bought these shoes to get from the car to the crag. Now I wear them every day, and I am deciding if its a bad thing to get two in different colors. 

The inner sleeve idea that Arcteryx has is an innovative idea. I love it. No blisters, ever. The firm sole gives me plenty of leverage on small climbs. I've done a 5.6 to a 5.8 with these shoes. In fact climbing with ascent style shoes have offered a new dynamic in climbing for me. In stead of 2nd guessing a small jib, I can just take the shoe and jam it into a crack and use that as a bomber foot hold. I love it.

The drawbacks for this shoe is if you're wide footed, like me.  It took me a few days to break this shoe in. And it took some minor  adjusting of the laces to acommodate my foot type.

From backpacking with heavy loads to kicking around camp w/o socks on, I'm shocked at how well these shoes support my feet.
When i first saw the 'liner sock' I thought it was gimmicky, but 4 backpacking trips(everything from really wet and cold to dry and hot) later with ZERO hot spots--the sock liner is genius.
When completely saturated, the shoes dried in ~3 hours of sitting in direct sunlight, and 1 hour of dry hiking.

I am wearing Darn Tough (hiker - light cushion) socks with them.  I took the advice from reviews on this site and others and ordered a half size smaller from what I normally wear ... I ordered US 9.5 Mens.  I wear a US 10 Mens in everything else ... for dress shoes (Allen Edmonds) size 10 C.  
I replaced the insole they came with, with SOLE Signature EV Ultra insoles (that I've had for a few years) and they fit/feel just fine ... though the insoles they came with look pretty good.  I plan on trying both insoles out in these.  
The Adaptive Fit liner is attached to the shoe on the bottom.  
The shoes have a stable feel (especially side-to-side) when I walk in them ... confidence building for backpacking. 
I had an Arcteryx Theta AR jacket for 14 years (just replaced it with the latest Theta AR rendition) and different Arcteryx undergarments and shirts and have liked all of them ... just had to try out their new venture into footwear.  
I will be going on a backpack trip in a couple weeks.  I will give an update after the hike.
The most straightforward review of the Arcteryx Acruz FL Approach Shoe I have found is at a website called itstactical.com.  The site also reviews tying them in a manner to ""lock the heel.""

UPDATE (July 8, 2015): Back from 18 mile round-trip backpack trip in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana (find Kerlee Lake), with additional miles scrambling.  The shoes worked great.  The steep, mostly off-trail portion (1.5 miles) from Tin Cup Creek drainage to Kerlee Lake was helped immensely by the good edging capability of these shoes.  They grip great on rocks and even wet rocks.  
I ended up opting for the less voluminous insoles that they came with because they kept my feet a bit lower in the shoe and prevented the back part of my foot (where Achilles tendon attaches) from getting irritated (this can happen in other shoes, too, for me - not unique to this shoe).  Thus, if I was to use an aftermarket insole, I would get a less voluminous one.
The soles didn't show much wear at all, considering the Bitterroot granite we were going over.  I even had to wear them walking some considerable distance in a creek and they worked well.  They weren't totally dry by morning, but didn't have the heavy water-logged feel when I put them on.  They started drying faster once I started walking in them that morning.
Can't wait to use them on my next backpack trip.
I have toe clips on my cross bike and these shoes work great in them, too ... can feel the better power transfer to the crank.
These really are purpose-built shoes - though plenty comfortable, they are not plush.  It appears that they will last a long time.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-06-09 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

I’m kind of a gear-head and all my pants, even the ones I wear to work, can be described as tactical. I got a size 32 in these and I’ve had them just over a year.

WHAT: In a word, stretchy. This is a technical pant that you can wear casually or for travel. It’s great in warm climates and can stand up to heavy use like tough hiking scrambles or climbing. The great cut and stretchy material of these pants moves with you.

WHEN: For where I live these are year round pants on all but the coldest winter days. They’ve become my go-to pants for cooler weather activities. And they’re always in my bag when I’m on the road.

WHERE: Hiking, traveling, casual Fridays at work, pretty much anything active.

WHY: They’re the funnest pants I own. I even have the shorts version.

STYLE: If you like the look of a technical pant then you’ll love these just as much as I do. They have a clean look that can be worn casually but stand out enough that you can tell these aren't just a normal pair of pants.

FUNCTION: All the technical stuff: gusseted crotch, articulated knees, quick drying, water resistant and durable. Nothing is unnecessary on these, there’s no belt loops and only 3 pockets (none in the back, one zippered right thigh). There is a built-in belt that works well while wearing the pants but is not so good in my dryer. The belt (on both the pants and shorts) has gotten caught several times and twisted-up the whole load.

My buns used to get cold on the lift but now remain comfortable throughout the whole day. Coming out of the mountains, these have become my favorite running tight as the compression really keeps my blood flowing, but also keeps any excess fabric from getting in the way of each step. On top of that, the right thigh pocket is perfect for a house key while on the run, or a ski pass, ID and credit card while on the mountain.

If I had purchased the exact size I wear in jeans I probably would not have even been able to put them on.

I took a chance on this and it has been perfect. Kept me warm at 4am when it was cold out and didn't start to really heat up until noon when the temperature rose above 60 degrees in direct sunlight. I'm hard on the stuff I own, where other companies clothing would get snags or pill in certain spots, I have yet to see any signs of wear on this yet. I was looking for something a little more form fitting, so that is the only complaint I have, however my shoulders and chest don't typically allow for me to where a medium in anything.

I have used this pack for both technical purposes (i.e., climbing and hiking) as well as just basic commuter/daily purposes and I find it works great for both. However, it clearly is designed, and excels the most, in the alpine environment.

Pros:
(1)	The pack is amazingly lightweight for its size (there is a caveat to the size I will mention later).
(2)	It is incredibly durable and water proof. I personally have yet to tear a hole into this pack or managed to have any water permeate it whatsoever.
(3)	Simplistic design with just enough support in its frame and straps
(4)	The design allows it to hold tightly to your body, which is incredibly important in a pack while climbing.
(5)	Easy to manipulate (i.e., open the main and external compartments, put on/take off, adjust straps, unclip waistbelt) in the freezing cold while wearing multiple layers of gloves. Hell, although I haven’t tried, you could probably do everything you need to even with mittens on.
(6)	Ice axe/tool attachments are easier to use than traditional attachments
(7)	Crampon straps work great. I thought my crampons would have cut these by now, but I have yet to have any issues. Also, you can use the straps for other things you need to attach on the outside (e.g., helmet, belay jacket)
(8)	I actually find the key hook in the external pocket quite useful most of the time. That said, I am not carrying my house keys on me for big alpine objectives and haven’t found a use for it then.

Cons:
(1)	Expensive, but it find it is worth it
(2)	It lacks the external attachment points that are found on the Alpha FL 45. I found these quite useful for the 45L version, particularly for attaching boots for approaches.
(3)	The size is a bit deceiving, as the size in the name of the product is actually the size with the roll top fully expanded.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-11-01 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Arc'teryx","Rush Jacket - Men's","3744075",5,"I just got the Arc'Teryx Rush Jacket in Magmatic in the mail and I am pumped to take it and put it through some punishment.  I will post another review after a few weeks of regular use but I wanted to get some initial thoughts down.  

Fit:  I am 6'1"" and 190 lbs. I am 43"" around the chest, 34"" around the waist 40"" around the hips and 35"" on each arm and I ended up with a medium.  Based on the sizing chart I was a medium in some categories and a large in others.  I bought both a medium and a large and would recommend doing so if you are at all close to my size.   After putting on all of my gear intended for the coldest of days (base layer, beacon, flannel shirt, Patagonia Nano Puff vest,  Arc'Teryx Cerium LT Hoodie, Arc'Teryx Rush Hard Shell, Helmet, Patagonia Powder bowl Pants and a climbing harness) the Medium ended up fitting me the best, especially when adding a back pack and harness on top of the jacket.  The Large was fine and could work however, there seemed to be a lot of extra material which bunched up under back pack straps and especially under the waist strap of my harness.  Don't get me wrong though, with all of this gear there is no room to spare in the jacket.  I can still fill the pockets with gloves, map, GPS, or a radio with no issue but that is it.  No room for a water bottle unless it is flat (platypus type).  Given that I run hot and that 90% of the time I only wear a flannel and a vest under the jacket the medium just made sense for me.  Also I now regularly use a radio and have resorted to storing my beacon in my ski pants to avoid signal interference which has freed up some space in the jacket. 

Functionality:  This jacket has all the right features that I was looking for.  A pocket on the arm for my ski pass, a powder skirt, helmet compatible hood, and two long deep pockets on either side of the jacket that are accessible while wearing a pack.  The pockets run almost the entire length of the chest and could easily fit a long folded up map, water bottle, radio, or gloves.  The collar of the jacket is cut high and will cover most of the face if zipped all the way up.  With a simple shoulder shrug the collar comes up even higher to just under the goggles - perfect for the lift ride up.  The color (magmata) definitely pops against the snow and adds a ton of visibility.  It seems that Arc'Teryx has really nailed some colors that seem to get brighter as visibility decreases which I think is a bonus.  The jacket also stuffs into the hood to the size of a small football which makes packing it way while skinning up to the next line a snap.

Price:  Not sure why this jacket is 50 - 75 dollars more than the Sabre which is all N80P Gore-tex (not just the shoulders) and has a little bit of insulation/similar features.  In the end I sprung for the Rush for it's packability, weight, and I'll be honest - the color.

Cons:  700 dollars!!!!!  I know that you get all of the above cool features in a bombproof construction that fits like it was made by my Hong Kong tailor but wow that's a lot of money.  I started this jacket search about a month ago and actually bought the Patagonia Powder Bowl jacket.  In the end I took it back because the only pocket it had was two small hand pockets and a weird chest pocket that is really only good for a phone or anything else you don't want to access with gloves on.  I love Patagonia, they took it back with no questions and even gave me some stickers.  They just need to up their functionality a bit and I am right there with them.  Which brings me to customer service. Back Country is great.  Arc'Teryx leaves a bit to be desired and while they do take care of you, turn around is long.

All in all, I am happy with the fit/function of the jacket and I look forward to getting out this week to see how it stands up to the high price tag.

"Arc'teryx","Rush Jacket - Men's","106622785",5,"I'm 5'11"" and 175lbs with an thicker athletic build and typically prefer a large in ski jackets. I was looking for a jacket that could do it all; skiing inbounds in the nastiest weather that Old Man Winter can throw at me, touring all day long, and everything in between. I also prefer a looser fitting jacket and this caught my eye, haven't regretted a dime spent towards it.

Pros:
- It really is a bomber material in terms of both durability and waterproofing. I've spent a few days out when it was absolutely dumping out and hovering around 32/33 degrees and this lives up to both the Gore Tex and Arc'teryx name.
- I personally have found the large is definitely baggy on me, which I like for layering purposes. Some reviews below say its a trim fit, it doesn't seem remotely that way. The expedition fit is exactly that, meant to layer and room for it.
- I like the pocket situation for the most part. There's two large side chest pockets that are plenty big, i'll stuff a pair of gloves in if I need to take mine off one the chairlift. The pass pocket is nice too if you spend anytime resort skiing. There is an inner chest pocket, its sort of mediocre though as an iPhone 6 w/ a Lifeproof case doesn't fit.  I would dig an outside chest pocket. Can't win them all I suppose.
- Oversized helmet does what it needs to on storm days.
- I've toured now several days in this jacket and it rocks for breathability. I'll tour in the shell alone with a base layer as I tend to run hot and never feel that I get too sweaty.

Cons:
- Other than the pocket situation described above, honestly not much. 

Overall, if you're looking for a bomber waterproof jacket that you'll be skiing both backcountry and resort skiing in, look no further. It will be a larger cut to account for layering.

First day with this jacket brought howling winds at 60+ mph, driving wet snow, and a dampness that finds its way to your inner core. The Rush did not disappoint. No wind, no dampness, and the integrated hood over my helmet was indispensable for a big weather day. Layer this baby with an Arc'teryx RHO base and you become totally impervious to the elements. The vents let you stay warm on the lift and dissipate heat at the bottom of the mogul run.  Spendy? Yup, but worth every penny. I wear a medium in this jacket.

No wind, no dampness, and the integrated hood over my helmet was indispensable for a big weather day. Layer this baby with an Arc'teryx RHO base and you become totally impervious to the elements. The vents let you stay warm on the lift and dissipate heat at the bottom of the mogul run.  Spendy? Yup, but worth every penny. I wear a medium in this jacket.

Now that the Haku has come out I am psyched.  I ended up getting two of these since my girlfriend also has a Miura 50 and we own a lot of ropes. 

First it fits very well into the bottom of the Miura 50 vertically if you have a 70+m rope in there and horizontally if you have a 60m or a very thin cord.

The design is ingenious.  When you start climbing the rope feeds out of the bag like a rope bucket and once the pitch is done the whole thing sits neatly on the tarp.  When its time to move or pack up you just pick up the corners of the tarp and poof the rope drops into the bag via a ""trap door"" which keeps it flaked and ready to be dispensed once more.  The bag also has a convenient shoulder strap so you can walk it over to the base of the next rig with ease.  

When you are totally done just pick it up, the rope drops in, stuff in the tarp, and roll the thing dry bag style.  Slick and easy.  I'm glad the Pali has a venerable heir. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2013-02-01 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Arc'teryx","Alpha SV Jacket - Women's","505555996",5,"Intro: I got this puffy for daily use in SLC in the winter, backcountry use, winter camping/snowshoeing etc. I have used it regularly since I received it and really love it. 

Fit: I am 5’5” (athletic/climber – so sometimes have trouble with tops fitting arms/shoulders) and I ordered a small. I can comfortably wear a fleece jacket or mirco synthetic puffy jacket under this one and I can wear a gortex shell over the top. I normally wear smalls in jackets, but also like a snug/fitted fit. If you like your jackets bigger, then size up. This jacket is a shorter crop than other down jackets. If you have a long torso (I don’t), you would be better off getting one of the longer cut downs. 

Performance/Use: This is one of the warmer arc’teryx puffy jackets and I think it has performed well in its use. Ive used it snowshoe camping when sitting around camp. It keeps me warm in 0-20 degree weather in the Uintas when worn over a baselayer/midlayer and below a gore-shell. I run cold though, so like a LOT of warmth. When doing activity, this jacket packs up fairly small for an 850 fill heavy duty down. If you want a puffy for easy and small packing you might consider getting the AR, LT or SL version of this jacket, though they likely won’t be as warm. I definitely can’t wear this jacket when working out hard, because it gets warm really fast. 

Pros/Cons: Pro: really warm, well made, fits well. Has elastic cinches along waistline to cinch down in cold/windy weather, has cinched sleeves and a well fitted hood. Love the stash sack pocket inside and packs up fairly well. 
Cons: Not waterproof – can’t wear alone in snowy/wet conditions. This jacket does not have a helmet compatible hood so it is not ideal for skiing etc where you would be wearing a helmet. (I did not purchase this for this reason, so not truly a con, but just good to know). If you want a down jacket you can wear skiing with a hood they make ski/board specific jackets that are down with a waterproof exterior shell all in one. This jacket is also potentially short for some who have a longer torso.

So while I can't speak to the specifics of the current model on a day-in-day-out level, I can say this -- it is 2014 -  and this thing has been across the country with me.  It has gone up mountains, down mountains.  It's traveled hundreds of miles off shore (remote-island life and whale watching).  It has lasted through many summers of field work (read: bushwacking, hiking through clearcuts, 5-year old clearcuts, in terrible weather day in and day out).  It has helped me through a master's thesis and 3 different jobs (it even effectively shed my tears when I got laid off when the economy tanked).  It has been outside through the duration of 3 different hurricanes (all activities during hurricanes not endorsed by author).

I'm still dry.  Never once gotten the least bit wet.  Never once did I think it was not breathable enough.   Despite being dragged through terrible brush, it doesn't have holes.  It's a little dirty - but less dirty than anything else I've owned this long.

"Arc'teryx","Sentinel Jacket - Women's","108558357",4,"This jacket is exactly what I was looking for. There are a few reasons why I chose it. Obviously I wanted this jacket to be breathable yet very waterproof. So far the Gor-Tex Pro 3 layer has not let me down! The length is great! I like my shells to be a bit longer then what is usually offered in hard shell jackets. Also, I didn't want this jacket to be too heavy but I did want just a small amount of lining for extra warmth. The inside lining in this jacket is very soft. It provides just the right amount of extra warmth and comfort in case I need it. It is a very flattering fit yet still provides enough room for my synthetic or down mid-layer.  To me this is a pretty big investment, so I wanted to get a color that I knew I would like for a few years. I went with the Marianas. It’s a very deep, dark purple that goes well with the rest of my ski gear. I wanted to invest in a jacket that would last for a while, and I found it! I'm super excited for all of my future adventures in this jacket!

Update: After using this jacket for a couple of months I do have to update one thing.... I still love this jacket and am incredibly happy with it however I do believe I can now only give it a 4 because of the powder skirt. The powder skirt will only attach to Arc'teryx pants, and only pants with the Slide 'n Loc™ snap closure attachment. Don't get me wrong, if you have/plan on buying the pants then this feature is fantastic! This only started being a problem for me with all of the incredible powder days we had in January. If you do not plan on buying Arc'teryx pants then you may want to make sure that the powder skirt will stay down when you're really moving out there on the slopes/in the backcountry.

It's just a shell with no interior insulation layer, but I knew that when I purchased it, and purchased an arcteryx atom lt jacket to wear underneath.

I was pleased that it's perfectly waterproof and that I wasnt even damp after skiing in heavy lake-effect snow and grauplel. The front zipper comes up HIGH and covers my entire neck gaitor, although I do still wear a neck gaitor for the fleecy comfort, as this has just a minimal zipper cover. The hood fits over my big round helmet (smith gage) and has a stiff visor on the top. The pit zips are long and easy to wrangle- I just hold the cuff with my arm up in the air to hold the fabric taut when pulling the zips. The pocket situation is sparse- I usually put my phone in my atom pocket and then kept my credit card and id in the tiny inner chest pocket in this jacket. I do like the left arm pocket here for an rfid resort pass.

I'm usually between sizes thanks to a long torso, smaller waist/bust, broad shoulders and wide hips , so nothing ever fits perfect but I'm happy with my choice to go up a size for this purchase. 

The extra room allows me to layer for those days with mixed conditions. The length of the torso is great, hits right at mid-butt level (with my long torso). Arms are long enough I can reach overhead without them coming past my wrists. The upper arm area seems to have a lot of extra fabric. While aesthetically it annoys me a little when I'm only wearing the shell, if I ever needed to wear a super heavy puffy for insulation with this jacket there would be plenty of space to do so. 

The pocket situation is lacking, With the micropocket as the only inside pocket, I have to keep my wallet and mobile in an outside pocket. That's the biggest downside to this jacket for me.

In the past I have usually gone for insulated jackets that have an excessive amount of features like wrist gators with thumb holes, magnetic snaps to keep the hood back, etc., but found that while they worked well for colder days on the resort, they were not versatile for anything else. I needed something that would provide warmth on colder days when paired with a micro down, could act as a lighter jacket for backcountry, or back bowl days that required hiking, and spring skiing. 
While I was skeptical about moving to a technical shell, I couldn?t be more pleased. And I am pleasantly surprised at how I don?t miss all the extra features too. The pit zips are deep which is a huge plus for longer hikes.

I have even enjoyed having it for mountain biking on cooler wet days in the spring/fall because it breaths so well and give you slightly more coverage than rain jacket.  

I also purchased this jacket in a medium which seems to work better with the heavier down jackets and gives you a little extra length without adding too much bulk. If you think you are between sizes or like a looser/longer fit size up.

I've worn it up to the hill as my every day  jacket once. The temps were cool (lower 20's) for the Northwest and I'll admit it would have been a bit nicer with a puffy vest or additional insulation underneath.

I do agree with the poster below me in regards to the size an that is the only negative thing I have to say about this jacket. I was in between the L and XL and opted for the L. While the shoulders and arms fit well (and I'd say even have a  little extra room), the waist is smaller than I would expect. Still today I find myself wondering if I should have opted for the XL but always end up reminding myself that while the extra room in the hips would be great, the extra room in the arms would be a total bummer.

First, each style fits quite differently so try it on!!! I am perfectly in between sizes in this brand. Can't ever decide between a small and a medium. In the sentinel, the small has HUGE arms (width), yet they are not very long. The hip/waist of this jacket is unusually small. I say this jacket is made for someone with broad shoulders and a teeny tiny waist and hips (picture a fit body builder) However, the size difference between the small and the medium makes the arms just way too big and doesn't fix the problem with the waist. The waist/hip is still pretty small. 

OH and one more thing! There is no true media pocket in this jacket, or any other arcteryx jackets I have owned. I've had to snip a hole in the inside to feed the headphones through, which is so hard to do on such a pricey piece of clothing!

My main use will probably be casual but I wouldn't hesitate to take it hiking in the winter.   After reading the reviews, I decided to go with a Medium.   For my size, the Medium fits close to the body.  I can wear it over a t-shirt/ flannel shirt combo and I can also wear it over a light synthetic base layer/Arcteryx fleece jacket combo (the jacket is similar to the Arcteryx Delta LT Fleece Jacket - mine is an older version but looks to be about the same weight of fleece).  With these combos, I have zero extra room in the vest.  The fit in the chest feels the closest but it's not pulling the stretch material on the sides of the vest.  The waist is spot on.  I can run a single finger all the way around the inside hem but that's it.  There's no drawcord at the waist so I wanted the fit to be close.  

Just to be safe, I decided to contact Arcteryx and see how the size Large would compare to the Medium.  Here's what I received:

Here are the measurements for the Atom LT vest.

Medium:
Chest Width 113cm
Waist Width 107cm
Bottom Width 107cm
FT Length 69.6cm
CB Length 74cm

Large:
Chest Width 121cm
Waist Width 115cm
Bottom Width 115cm
FT Length 72.4cm
CB Length 76.5cm

So, essentially, you're picking up a little over 3 inches in the body and about an extra inch in the length.  

For me, I decided to stick with the Medium.  I like the close fit at the hem and I would rather have the vest be a little snug vs. the extra room the Large would provide.  I'm ok with the length too but, if your stretched out (say, on a bike), the extra inch of length, on the Large, might be nice.  If you're my size, it seems like you could wear either size depending on  your preference for fit and desired use.

And maybe best of all, they take less room (and less weight) in the backpack or clipped to a harness. Scrambling /climbing seemed on par with other shoes I've had.

Here’s what’s good about this pack:
(1)	It is very lightweight. I find that it beats most of the competition.
(2)	It is the perfect size for it’s purpose—enough to carry an extra layer, your water, some food, extra gear (e.g., headlamp, map, keys, phone, etc.)
(3)	Durable and relatively waterproof

Here’s what I don’t like:
(1)	I don’t like the compression “SwiftCord.” I don’t personally see much of a use for it, and I find it gets caught on things too easily (e.g., trees, rocks, doorknobs).
(2)	The lack of a frame makes things shift around and objects stick into your back if you do not pack it thoughtfully
(3)	I haven’t figured out how to use the key clip. The one of the Alpha FL is much more intuitive.

 Almost every coat has a DWR coating, which isn't made like it was years ago due to EPA.

"Arc'teryx","Theta AR Jacket - Men's","105908977",5,"I've been searching for a new shell for hiking, climbing, and most of all, skiing (backcountry and lifts).  I spent tons of time reading reviews before dropping some serious coinage on a shell.  I'm 5'9 175 lbs, athletic build, 33"" sleeve, 40"" chest, and I'm somewhere in between a large and a medium in everything.

I figured large was the way to go for layering, but I was afraid I'd be swimming in the Theta, so I opted for the Beta in large instead.  Whoops.  Don't get me wrong... the Beta is a beautiful shell, but I had wayyy to much room in the chest/shoulders while the length was definitely too short for skiing.  I promptly returned it and purchased a  Theta in medium. YES!

I'm amping to get this thing outdoors.  The fit of the Theta is perfect!  It's not too baggie without layers, but I can comfortably fit a base layer and Atom AR under it.  I can squeeze a  fleece under the Atom AR if necessary, but things start getting a little cramped at that point.  I love the sleeve pocket, and the pocket placement will accommodate a pack nicely.  The length is spot on, but not too long to stop me from using this while climbing/hiking.

Maybe I'll report back in a couple months about how the Theta holds up, but from everything I've read, this thing's bombproof.  But if you're trying to figure out the fit, definitely size down...even if you're layering.  And average height guys, don't worry about the length.

The size and cut are great. I'm 5'10"" and a fairly athletic 180lbs (climber shoulders, cyclist legs) and this fits me perfectly. I can layer a wool base layer and size medium Atom LT under it with no problem, and squeeze a thick fleece under the Atom for sub-zero days.

It clears climbing/biking helmets, harnesses and backpacks without any annoyances, though it's long enough to cover gear loops up and that you need to rearrange it a bit around a bike saddle.  Small price to pay for how well it covers you.  It seals out EVERYTHING on a really cold day, but still breathes great with the vents open.

They were AWESOME!!!!  Not only did they not need any breaking in, but they were super comfortable and absolutely stellar on the snowfields.  OK - crampons would have been better, but we were ill prepared and these shoes made kicking snow steps a breeze while keeping my feet dry and comfy.

"Arc'teryx","Acrux FL GTX Approach Shoe - Women's","5301222",4,"I was pretty nervous about these shoes reading the reviews below but I decided to give them a chance because I've had good luck with other Arc'teryx products. 

A few things to note: These run HUGE - I would recommend sizing down a full size. I typically take a 6-6.5 and the 6's were quite large on me.

I've heard mixed results on people wearing these shoes with or without socks. Because mine were a little loose, I opted to wear socks with them. I found this to be comfy.

I was super nervous because the first outing with these shoes was a 9 mile backpacking trek into the Uintas - NO TIME TO BREAK THEM IN. 
I wore them around the grocery store for about an hour the day before and was pretty concerned with how stiff they felt. 
But surprisingly, they felt awesome on the trail. They definitely provided a little more give and flexibility as I put miles on them. 

I tested them in near perfect conditions for what these shoes are designed to endure. Seriously rugged, rocky terrain in variable weather from pouring rain to spitting. The trail was absolutely sopping from 24+ hours of rain and I hate nothing more than wet feet trapped in swamp pits all day. These shoes kept me bone dry through all the muck, mud, rain and river crossings. 

These things are rugged! They protected my toes and soles from the non-stop outcroppings of sharp rocks and pebbles we encountered on our hike in. We took 5 pack goats with us, and when saddling them up, one of the goats actually stepped on my foot - didn't hurt. Boom. 

I disagree with the statement that these are 'quick drying'. 
Near the end of our sojourn in a goat knocked me off my boulder perch in the middle of the biggest, fiercest stream crossing. One foot was totally submerged for about 15-20 seconds so the shoe did get wet. If you totally submerge them - this situation is unfavorable. They were awesome UNTIL they got dunked and I found that they weren't really drying out at all as we hiked our last miles in. They required a whole night and a sunny morning to dry completely, so just be really cautious and avoid submersion if you can.  The really nice part is you CAN get the tongue and upper of this shoe wet without the moisture seeping inside - which is pretty cool. You won't find that functionality with most GTX hikers, but like any shoe that is completely submerged, discomfort will ensue. 

Loved the SUPER knobby, traction-loving soles on these Acrux shoes. We crossed over 20 streams and creeks and I had perfect confidence scrambling over wet boulders, precariously placed (thin) balance beam style logs, and mossy outcroppings. I never had a moment where I didn't trust these shoes. If you live in a wet climate or backpack where lots of stream crossings will be encountered, these are AMAZING. I felt just as surefooted as the goats we brought along. 

Color is BRIGHT. Smurf bright. I actually felt borderline ridiculous walking into the grocery store, because people definitely notice these things and will comment. Opt for a lighter color than the blue if BLINGBLING isn't your thing. 

Overall: I would recommend these to hikers/climbers/packers who live in wet climates or plan to cross many a waterway. They aren't so stiff as you'd expect pulling them out of the box. Just give them a little love and they will treat your feet right. ","EMPLOYEE","2015-08-11 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Arc'teryx","Fission SV Insulated Jacket - Men's","100109043",5,"Unusual review for me.  I was looking for the warmest jacket I could find with literally some of the best cold weather climbing  jackets hanging in my gear room now.  That included both the Arcteryx Kappa and a Fission SL.  The list got one more this winter with the Fission SV.  I ordered up new versions of each from BC.  Tried them all on and kept the SV.   The others went back...nothing new theere from what I already had.   A life style new to me, but for the last 6 months I've been getting up just prior to dawn,  rain, shine or snow to feed livestock for the last 6 months.  One of the coldest winters on record here.  The Kappa, a trusted friend for winter climbing in the Alps and Canada wasn't warm enough.  The Fission SL, the ""go to"" hard core winter climbing  coat,  wasn't up to the task when the wind started blowing @ -25F.   Mind you both Arcteryx jackets really good cold weather pieces!   But this is an honest comparison made by wearing all three day after day of multiple sub zero weeks this winter.   The SV is slightly longer, sheds wind much better than the other two and because of both the length and wind resistance,  it is noticeably warmer.  The double chest pockets are handier if required.  I now know why you see this jacket on a lot of full time ski instructors in the Rocky Mtn States.  Not seen a warmer jacket that can take a real beating (day in and day out on the ski hill or in the barn) and still do the job just as well at the end of the Season as the beginning.  If you really need a cold weather jacket the SV is worth the extra price compared to the  Kappa for warmth IMO.  Although feature to feature the Kappa is a better buy if it is warm enough for you.  The Fission SL is a great climbing jacket for warmth and weight.   But I find it hard to justify the price when compared to the other two.  For a climbing parka and really cold dry occasions (think of missing the Tram mid winter on the Midi) my impression is  you can do better for warmth and weight (short of snow cave living) by going to one of the better down jackets intended for the same use.  Still not a big fan of the SV's style but it is now the only COLD WEATHER jacket I have hanging in our mud room getting daily use.  And it is  THE jacket I grab when I want to be warm and protected from the weather/elements on foot, on a horse or on a 4x4.  Given the choices I have available that is saying a lot.     It is still not the jacket I would take climbing.  It is too heavy and not cut for climbing.  Kappa and SL are light and cut to climb in.   But the Fission SV is the one jacket  I wish I had when I really need a warm jacket.  Simply because it is the warmest most weather resistant synthetic I own.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-28 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

Skiing in NH in January on one of the coldest days of the year posed no problem.  The jacket's pretty light for its warmth and toughness, and I skied in it great.  I usually get quite warm and sweat easily, but I wore a thin base layer and light fleece underneath anyway; even so, I skied for seven hours that day with temperatures below freezing and had a great time.

I've also had lots of fun skiing on an awesome 3 ft pow day and sledding on a day off from school.  The jacket's hem/hood cords and cuffs hold great, and the fantastic DWR and Gore-Tex kept me dry; I didn't have any snow inside the jacket after a few hours of sledding.

I am ~37"" chest, ~30.5"" waist, 125 lbs, and my previous favorite jacket was a ca. 2009 Norrona Falketind Pac-Lite jacket (size S).  When I replaced it was a ca. 2012 Norrona Falketind GT-Pro jacket (size S), I was really let down because the cut of that jacket is far larger (especially in the upper and lower torso).  Now, with this Beta LT (size S), the fit is fabulous - it's slim but I have full range of motion of my arms and have room to fit a Mountain Hardwear Nitrous insulated layer.  The construction is top-notch (Made in China, if that matters to you).  BUT, there are a few drawbacks that keep it at 4.5 stars if that was an option to select:
1) The hood doesn't cinch as tight as Norrona's.  It does cinch down a fair bit, but if I'm not wearing a helmet or another hooded layer underneath, it doesn't quite go tight enough to grasp onto my head like Norrona's.
2)  There are no pit-zips.  I realize this is by design, but because I tend to use it for more active pursuits, I would have loved the addition.
3)  The main zipper is smooth, but I must say that it feels kind of dainty in hand.  Only time will tell if it puts up with the abuse over the next few years - I hope so!

"Arc'teryx","Beta LT Jacket - Men's","657653996",5,"Fit: 6'2"" 190lbs  - Large
Fit is athletic with enough room to layer all but hte thickest of down jackets. Fits perfect with a Atom LT.

The proshell on the lighter weight LT is much nicer in my opinion then that on the AR the ripstop is on the inside instead of the outer layer so its not visible, meaning a smoother face on the fabric. 

Jacket is long in the back which is perfect for the hip cut.
Pockets are easy to access and large. the new style zipper on the front works great, really happy to see the laminated zipper gone. 

Wish it had pit zips, but more out of nostalgia. Fabric breathes well enough I haven't needed them yet. Seems are stitched and welded perfect, arms are articulated so they are not restrictive when you move. large cuffs so you can get a large gps watch in and out without issue.

Perfect year round jacket, light enough to wear on its own in the summer and just enough room to layer for the winter.

Another Note: The pockets are gore on the interior as well so they cannot be used as vents

"Arc'teryx","Atom AR Hooded Insulated Jacket - Women's","1318022140",5,"Wow, this thing is super lightweight! So light and thin that I fear it won't be warm enough, but I'm reserving judgement on that until I've tested it. This winter in Ohio has been spring so far, with high temps in the 50s and 60s, so I can't really test this yet. I will say that on the 40 and 50 degree mornings, I've thrown this on and I did not overheat. It is very breathable and comfortable. It seems to stand up well against wind. If this thing truly takes me down through the winter temps as well, it will be the most versatile jacket I've ever owned. Fingers crossed and I will update once I've put it through more testing. The fit is absolutely amazing. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to layer under it because it seems so form fitting, and yet, somehow there is still space in here to layer. I should mention that I'm a 34 B, so your mileage may vary. The movement in the arms at the shoulder and elbow are like no jacket I've ever owned. Seriously, the arms/shoulders/elbows are brilliantly constructed for amazing ease of movement without the jacket riding up or limiting motion. I could do yoga in this jacket. Wow. Just wow. The collar is perfectly designed and very soft and comfortable when zipped up. There is even a little extra webbing along the top of the back in between the inner body of the coat and the hood, which provides coverage at the back of the neck when the hood is not on your head. Nice touch! No scarf needed. The hood fits brilliantly, gives great coverage, yet doesn't limit vision. I love that the hood is adjustable, great for those days when I wear my hair up in a bun or wear a bike helmet. The hood is designed to accommodate a helmet and has lots of volume. I do have a large, long head and a lot of hair, but with the adjustable design and brow construction, even those will smaller heads and less hair will likely still get a useable fit even when not wearing a helmet. This jacket works great as a mid layer too. Perfect stream lined fit under rain coats/outer shells. The design on the cuffs is the most comfortable I've had. Seamless coverage on the wrist with no constriction and no annoying buttons, velcro, or snaps etc. Slides under an outer layer like butter. Stays put when I move my arm around. The sleeves are very long, very long indeed, but the extra coverage is kinda nice and adds to the ease of movement. The fit overall is flattering and trim; doesn't make you look like a marshmallow. Rugged and ready for camp and trail, yet just stylish enough to get by for downtown walks. I have the black color. Mine arrived looking like it had been stuck in a backpack- lots of wrinkles, but its other charms have me overlooking the wrinkles. I should mention that the material makes a fairly noticeable crinkly sound, (if that kinda thing bothers you), another easily overlooked trait given the superior comfort and design. The only small quibbles I really have is that the coat seems a bit short in the front. Maybe I just have a long torso, but this does not really reach hip length on me. It feels just about an inch or two too short of where I'd comfortably expect it to be for good torso coverage. Also the hand pockets are just a bit shallow, could use a smidge more depth. But these are minor complaints on such a brilliant work of art. Certainly still deserving of this initial 5 star rating. I will update once it's handled some actual winter weather.

It's warm, functional, and fitting for everything I was looking for.

So breaking it down, pros and cons. 
PROS
1) comfort is incredible, I upgraded to this from the old black diamond momentum and the difference is astonishing. I attribute the comfort to the width of the waist belt. The only thing more comfortable would be  big wall harness (no experience with those, I live in Texas). Bring on the hanging belays. 4/5 stars for comfort. 

2) organization: I was quite content with the black diamond gear loops that stick out to the sides and make clipping/unclipping gear easy. I WAS a little concerned that I wouldn't like the arcteryx gear loop. no concern any longer. once you get a few quick draws/cams/whatever on there they are great. PLUS the 5th gear loop. like a genius, I only put stuff I know I won't use while leading on the 5th rear gear loop (ATC, Prusick, Anchor cordalette) so it's fine. But I will say it's pretty darn hard to get stuff from that loop. Just don't plan on putting your quick draws back there. 5/5 stars for organization. 

3) packability: pretty straight forward. It probably saves enough room (compared to old BD momentum) to fit an additional pair of shoe in my back. It compresses down to  about the size of both my fist. 5/5 stars for packability 

4)Function: This is what people talk about when they say ""I forgot I was wearing this harness"" It just moves with your body and conforms to your hips like a sweet lover (brown-chicken brown-cow). 5/5 stars for function. 

5) style: I think this harness looks pretty boss. The dark green with neon green accents is pimpen. 5/5 stars for style (which is what it's all about right?).

CONS

1) Price: the one and only true downside. One does not simply purchase arcteryx equipment without taking out a second mortgage. the only consolation is I was looking at the BD chaos (which is $125). I HIGHLY recommend spending the extra $20 to get his harness (or just get 2 $60 harness ha). 

2) adjustability: not a cons so much as an observation. If you're not used to fixed gear loops, it takes some getting used to. For reference, I normally wear a size 32 jeans and I measure the circumference of my leg was about 22.5 inches around. I got a size medium and it fits great. Enough room that I can layer up, and I wouldn't want leg loops any tighter.  currently they're snug but not tight or pinching by any means. 

Over all I highly recommend this harness for gear junkies like me who feel they need an expensive harness for some reason. but really, it's a very well designed piece of equipment and I'll probably purchase another arcteryx harness when I have to retire this one!

EDIT: right after I bought this harness, Black Diamond came out with their ""solution"" harness which appears to be very packable(thin like arcteryx), lightweight, with no 5th gear loop and much smaller gear loops but only half the price (and can probably find on sale sooner or later). While I haven't tried that harness, I can still say this. If you're just sport climbing (don't need a lot of racking space) you might wanna check out that harness. I also have multi pitch trad climbed with BD smaller gear loops and was totally fine. 

With that last part being said, I still give this harness 5 stars (maybe 4.5 considering the price) because it functions SOO well.

For sport climbing and gym sessions, its lightweight comfortable, and can hold more quickdraws than you'd ever need. In spite of the absence of padding I've never found it to be uncomfortable when hangdogging or on long belay duty. I haven't gotten to take it trad or multipitching yet but i image it'll hold up just fine and can pretty easily hold a typical single pitches worth of cams comfortably.

 Durability wise I've had it for a couple of months and so far can't see any signs of wear on it at all; it seems like its going to hold up very nice and I haven't noticed any bunching in the legs loops like have been mentioned with older versions of the AT harnesses.

"Arc'teryx","Tantalus Jacket - Men's","106707543",1,"I was super excited when I bought this jacket and I've used it about five times. Color is great, is trim fit, and is very protective from the elements.

However, there is a major issue with the durability of the face fabric. I kept my cellphone in my right pocket and after my very first day of on-piste snowboarding there was a small hole in the outer face fabric where the bottom corner of my phone was resting in my pocket. The next few times I took the jacket out I put my cellphone in the left pocket and later saw subtle, thin lines of degrading fabric matching the edges/size of my phone.

The pockets are extremely shallow so don't put anything other than maybe a few credit cards or cash or something. Maybe something soft like gloves would work. I have an android phone with a case and basically since the pocket is so thin that while snowboarding the phone got pushed against the outer fabric and created these series of small lines which are basically the beginnings of a rip in the fabric.

I had it sent in for warranty and they said this is just ""coincidence"" and all they can do is patch the hole and that's it. I've worn plenty of other shells that have functional pockets and never had any such issues with the fabric. It is a massive shame and let down that this amazingly expensive piece of gear can't hold anything in its pockets.

If you don't put anything big in the pockets you'll be fine. Don't take this through the trees or backcountry as it's likely to get scratched up and develop nicks and rips and holes quickly. Otherwise it's a great jacket if you're a careful, occasional, on-piste vacationer.

Well you should give the Arc'teryx Tantalus Jacket a try. The Tantalus jacket has reinforced lower arm/elbow area as well as reinforced shoulders and lower back. The extra reinforcement in those contact areas is nice when skiing in tight tree areas where tears and snags sometimes happen and for increased protection in inclement weather on the mountain. This Jacket is a great everyday option and handles everything from an average day on the mountain to windy whiteout conditions.

I've used the jacket a handful of times for other things in the meantime and love it so far.  I'm 5'9"" and 132, and a Small fits me great - close to the body but not restrictive at all.  (I wear slim fit and sometimes tailored slim fit dress shirts, and while I abhor the word ""skinny,"" it's what I've been called my whole life.)  It has these stretchy side panels all the way through the underarms, so it allows total freedom of movement.  I can even wear a base layer AND a thin microfleece jacket under the LT comfortably.

(I rated it as running small only because I'm so used to even Smalls being slightly too big for me in sports gear, and I've certainly never owned a jacket that fit so close to the body.)

Yesterday I wanted to field test what I am going to wear skiing at Big Sky this spring, so I had on a SmartWool base layer, the LT, and an unlined Gore-Tex shell to shovel during Snowzilla DC 2016.  I was perfectly warm under grey skies, light snow, and 27 degrees.  I didn't feel like I was sweating, but since I shoveled heavy, wet snow for two hours and was breathing hard, I probably would have realized I was, if I'd thought about it.  And when I went back inside, the LT was heavy with dampness - so I guess it really does wick away moisture and keep me comfortable!  I never thought about feeling wet or hot.  I don't know how fast it dried, though I'd wanted to note that, because I hung it up in the guest bath and forgot about it.

Today at 1:00 pm, I wore a cotton t-shirt, a microfleece, and the LT, and just shoveling for 30 seconds under sunny skies and 33 degrees, I was hot and immediately took off the LT.  After shoveling, I put it back on, and it was perfect for taking a leisurely walk at about 2:30 pm.  

It is extremely light, and that makes its performance all the more impressive, as well as making it a pleasure to wear.

I've worn it in town when it's been maybe 50 or so, and it's too cold if there's wind, since its breathability also means the wind goes right through.

It doesn't have a bag, but it packs into one of its own sleeves.  And you can do this cool parlor trick where with one yank of the wrist, the whole jacket reappears (you'll want to demo this for your friends) - but I have to say, when it comes out, it's completely wrinkled.  (Eventually the wrinkles work themselves out, but it looks pretty bad until then!  Next time I might try just folding it into fourths and flattening it in a Space Bag.)

It has this cool flap at the very top of the zipper so that the zipper doesn't come into contact with your neck if you zip it all the way to the very top.  And the wrists are snug (not tight like elastic), which is great since you may be putting on another layer... but it's easy to put your hand through the end because it's stretchy, like the side panels.

Finally, I used to wish the Arc'teryx logo was embroidered, but I just realized it's reflective, so you can be seen when walking at night - especially important with the dark charcoal or black colors!

All in all, a well-designed, great performing, very comfortable, good-looking jacket!  I'll let you know how it does for me on the slopes!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-01-24 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

The Atom is a little more breathable/less warm than the Nano Air, but it's the perfect companion under a hardshell skiing in less than frigid conditions, or as an everyday piece during the cool months, whether hiking or in town. For other reasons not related to this jacket, Arc'teryx is not a favorite brand of mine and I prefer other brands, but I'll give credit where credit is due. They generally make a good product, and this one is no exception. Fit is trim but not snug and with a nice bit of stretch to accommodate a full range of motion. I've had larges that I've been swimming in excess material, and larges where I can't hug because the shoulders or too tight, but this one sits perfectly in the middle. 

Also, just for comparison sake, I also own a ThermoBall hoody from The North Face. It was given to me by my work and has a large/bulky patch sewn onto the back, so for that reason I don't use it much for backcountry pursuits. But, if you're looking for lightweight warmth, the ThermoBall series is definitely warmer than both nano puff and atom series jackets, and is only a tad heavier.

I also have long arms (+1 ape index) and the jacket is long on my arms by about 1.5 inches, but I definitely prefer this over having them being too short. 

Because it has Gore-Tex Pro, Arc'teryx decided not to include the pit zips. For me, after skiing in some pretty warm weather, I wished a couple times that there were pit zips, but it is very, very breathable, and this is only a minor complaint. If you're hiking in very warm weather and you don't want to get clammy underneath your jacket, you might want to go with one of their other models with pit zips. I'm a moderate sweater.

As far as general performance goes, in my experience, I haven't found anything better than this jacket. If you're hesitating about the price, just keep in mind that if you take care of this jacket (use a technical gear wash--NOT normal detergent!), you'll have it for years and years.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-09-29 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

The quality of the pants is amazing like any other Arc'teryx item.

I have contacted Arc'teryx regarding the issues and they do not offer hemming.  You can alter the pants after market but Arc'teryx will not warranty the product.  However, they will warranty the zipper, belt etc.. nothing where the work was done or the waterproofing in the new seams

I did have my pants hemmed because I couldn't handle being an Oompa Loopa anymore... both pairs.  With the taped seams, stitching and tapered leg the tailor was not able to attach the hem chord the same and I also lost the Keprotec patches at the hem which is annoying.  I even tried to re engineer the pant so that the new seam would be in the middle of the shin area and keep the Keprotec at the hem but with the tapered fit at the bottom the pant itself didn't line up with four inches removed.  So after spending a combined $600 on the two pairs of pants I spent another 100 to try and get them to fit losing not one but two key features of these pants.  I have tons of Arc'teryx gear and I will never buy Arc'teryx pants again until they offer a shorter version.  

On a better note Patagonia offers a hemming service, it is 50 dollars however, they will guarantee the work done and make sure the pants are waterproof... and shorter.

But for my money (and in this case, a somewhat mind-numbing $300), these are the best alpine pants I've ever worn. These aren't pants to be worn if the temp is above 50 F, but below that in anything but a torrential downpour or a wet snow, the Gamma MX are unbeatable. I've worn them in the high mountains of New Zealand, backpacking a 50 pound load in a light snow. I've used them to patrol my property in winter, temps in the 10-40 degree range. I've worn them skiing. I wore them in driving rain and sleet for 90 minutes, and while wet on the outside, my legs were bone dry.

I always think they're going to be too hot for sweaty activities in cold temps, but they're not. They flawlessly modulate my body temp, whether I'm just walking or working hard. They shed snow without issue, and only strong winds below 20 degrees will get through the durable fabric.

It would be too warm for non-winter use in most of the Lower 48.  I used it recently on a climbing trip in the Alaska Range and found it perfect with or without long underwear underneath.  I occasionally wore puffy pants over the top for warmth but never needed to wear shell pants to block wind or water, as I would with a less burly softshell like the Gamma AR.  
Fit is trim but not tight--definitely more roomy than the Gamma AR pant.  The cuff fits snugly over ski boots (Maestrale RS) making gaiters unnecessary.  It fits less than snugly over double climbing boots (Baruntse), but you could get away without gaiters in anything but deep powder.  I would like to see a lace hook on the cuff like the Gamma AR has, to hold it down.  I installed grommets in the cuff and added a cord running underneath the boot, which works.
The roomy thigh pocket on the right side is great for a camera or other gear, but the velcro closure will let in snow if you get buried by spindrift or take a fall in powder--I'd rather have a zipper.

I would say they are true to size length-wise. However, they are a fairly narrow boot, so might not be best for those with wide feet. I've spent several days out in some deep snow, and even some Spring snow that is super wet and have not gotten wet or cold at all. The velcro strap allows for a nice ""walk mode"" and climb mode.  I would say these boots are great for up to 6000 m. One unique tweak to them I'd like to see would be a thinner liner available to use these boots as a single boot too.

After signing up for an ice climbing trip in Ouray, I realized some new boots might be in order.  After hearing great review about the Batura, I purchased a couple of different sizes online but they just didn't seem to fit, mostly due to heel slippage.  So I decided to give the new Acrux boots a shot.  They arrived 2 days before my trip and seemed to fit very well so I brought them along.  

These boots were seriously warm for the weight of them, even while standing around in Colorado in December while belaying.  They are waterproof on the outside with a zip up system that is bomber.  The double boot system is very easy and being able to pull the liner out at night to dry the boots is great.  While the lacing system may not be as advanced as the Batura, there is a velcro strap at the top which makes tightening a cinch. The only real issue I had is I felt some slight cramping in my feet which may be because of my low arches, so I took the liner out which fixed the problem, I think i'll look into a flat insole.

Needing a new pair of mountaineering boots for a winter trip to Colorado, I decided to take a chance on the new Acrux-something I NEVER do, that is buy a newly released product before many others have tried it out. And that holds doubly true for something that is life safety dependent such as a harness, rope, or mountaineering boot.

I was absolutely elated when I took them out of the box. But my spirits were soon dashed when I tried them on. Too narrow...they fit perfectly otherwise.

But in the interest of fairness these were/are the best mountaineering-style boots I've ever had on my feet. Pleasantly light but with a ruggedness you sense rather than see.  Quality was typical Arc'teryx-superb. Even the color is pleasant after having been optically assaulted by far too many garishly disgusting hues that clothing, equipment, and footwear manufacturers seem to be enamored  with.

Unfortunately I purchased the largest size that Arc'teryx makes (in this product) so I'm out of luck and will have to find another brand.

About a month ago I found it on the floor of my kit room- the hanger loop had fallen off.  I thought little of it.  I then wore it on a cliff walk on a stormy day- when I got home I realised that the waist seam had blown out completely- the glue and fabric had completely failed.

It's an expensive jacket but Arc'teryx has a lifetime guarantee.  So I sent the jacket to their warranty team.  I was astonished to be told today that the jacket 'has reached the end of its functional lifetime'.  They go on to talk about how zips, seams, cuffs etc all fail after time.  Mine has been worn maybe 20 times.  The fabric is immaculate other than the failure of the crappy seams.  I have written back to say that they need to look again at the other signs of usage...because it just isn't true, and will be evident to Arc Teryx, that it has been used extensively.

Frankly, this is a really expensive jacket and it has been a really bad purchase.  It looked OK and well made but it just isn't as good as other jackets I have from Patagonia or TNF.  I've hardly worn the thing, I thought I was protected by an expensive brand's guarantee, and it turns out that it was just a very bad purchase.

The point about it being black is that, because I could never find it, it basically sat in the bottom of wherever I last left it.  It was hardly used.

About a month ago I found it lying on the floor of my boot room- the coat hanging loop had come off, as the glue holding it in place had failed.  I thought that was a shame, but nothing more.  I then wore it on a stormy afternoon when I was walking on a coast path.  When I got home, I found that the wind had shredded the jacket- the waist seam had literally blown apart and the seam was completely torn.

I thought there must be a manufacturing problem so returned the jacket to Arc'teryx.  To my astonishment they have just now told me that the jacket will not be covered by their lifetime warranty.   The jacket has barely been worn- maybe 10 or 20 times since I bought it.  This is obvious from looking at it- the fabric (other than where the seams have fallen apart) is pristine and unmarked.  No frayed cuffs, chin abrasion, shoulder wear etc etc.  The glue holding it together has completely failed.  

Short version-this is an expensive jacket that comes from a reputable manufacturer, and it looks OK.

Arc'teryx Goret-Tex jackets are completely waterproof (as long as it is kept clean and reproofed from time to time) but the zippers are not. They are WaterTight zippers and sometimes under extreme conditions or if they are not completely zipped up there can be some moisture that seeps into the pockets. The zippers pass rigorous tests with WL Gore to meet their standards of extreme wet weather. 
 
There are no waterproof zippers on the market today (except in dry-suits and they are very stiff and difficult to operate) but we have worked with a private company to help invent the technology and YKK zippers now have been using the same technology and sell them to other manufacturers. 

It is also important to note that water will also soak into the outerface fabric and then cause condensation to build up on the inside inhibiting the breathability of the jacket which may also contribute to the moisture build up on the inside of the pocket. Regular maintenance of Gore-tex garments are needed to keep the performance working at its best. Please see link for Gore-tex washing instructions:  http://www.arcteryx.com/product-care.aspx?EN
We can also inspect your jacket to see if there is something defective about the zipper so if you wish, you can send us a Warranty Request Form and we will reply back to you with a Return Authorization number. Please see link below to fill out the Warranty Request Form.

"Arc'teryx","Alpha SL Jacket - Men's","109343514",5,"I haven't put this shell through the wringer yet (only used it a few times this year for spring skiing). But that said, it's the best shell I've owned. It's paper thin, but it keeps the wind out—even at the top of the tram in strong gusts. The slim fit makes it perfect for running or just wearing around in the rain, and the water bounces off the Gore-Tex. Despite the slim fit, it offers excellent mobility. It fits comfortably over a baselayer and my puffy, which is a bit boxy because it was made before slim-fitting outdoor gear became the style. 

The jacket is positioned as a helmet-compatible climber's shell, so I was worried it might not fit as well over a skier's helmet. I was wrong to be worried. It fits perfectly over a helmet, plus the drawstrings allow for optimal visibility and comfort without a helmet as well. 

On top of all that, it packs into the stuff sack to become the size of a cucumber—making it easy to toss in a pack and bust it out when you need it. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-05-24 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Arc'teryx","Alpha SL Jacket - Men's","4739743",5,"I thought finding a rain jacket that is light & breathable, durable, stylish, and well-priced was impossible. Normally you can get most of those things, but you have to sacrifice at least one––a jacket that is light & breathable, durable, and well-priced will probably look  horrendous, etc. 
Then there's the Alpha SL. 

When I first got it in the mail, I had my doubts it would last very long: the zippers seemed flimsy and the material was very, very thin. After few months of day-to-day wear, and ten days of downright abuse in Thailand, I can say that it's the best rain jacket I've ever owned. It kept me dry and comfortable in those spontaneous downpours, and the sleek design and bright color got me compliments left and right.

Still not convinced? Well, on a particularly soggy trek through the Thai jungle at 1:30am, I used it as an impromptu pack-cover (which put a lot of stress on the zippers). Fast forward to a few hours and A LOT of sharp undergrowth later, and not only is my expensive camera gear nice n' dry, the fabric and stitching around the zippers still look like new.

I also like the hood better on the Thorium, and I love how high the front zips up (great for bike commuting on a cold day in Colorado). My only complaint is that the Thorium's sleeves are slightly too short on me (I have very long arms). I usually wear a size 6 or 8 and I settled on a medium. No regrets.


Edit after 3 months: I have just noticed that the zipper now pulls down on its own, with very little prompting. Super annoying.

Since then I've used this fleece for many many different activities other than skiing  including road trips, flights, dog walking, cold winter sunday morning brunches in pjs, etc.....

It fits well - skims the body - and not tight anywhere. I can easily wear a light layer underneath with no problem. As well as a layer on top since it's not bulky like some fleeces are. It hits at your hip so not too long it gets in the way and not too short that you expose lower back or belly when you lift up your arms. 

It has a useful left top-of-arm pocket as well as side hand warming pockets. It's soft, stretchy so you can move easily and it comes in great colors (I have azulene).

The only downside with it is that if you sweat enough in it, it will smell afterwards and need washing. So it's not great for repeated hard activity wearing unless you don't care about being smelly.

I will have to sell the previous to afford them, but they are absolutely worth it, best pair of ski pants I have ever owned in my life (for a good mix of ski touring and skiing in-bounds, mostly in Utah, but with travel to other climates (British Columbia, Norway, Quebec, etc). 

Cons: 
1. A little long, but that's nit-picking. I am 5'5"" and need an XL to accommodate my hips and thighs, so I'm sure the length is great for taller ladies. 

2. Pricey.

Pros: 
1. The N70P Gore-Tex is amazing. Waterproof, and it even has a little bit of stretch. It's also more of a soft ""matte"" fabric vs traditional hard-shell fabrics (i.e. the ones that make more noise). The inside of the fabric also has these tiny hairs that help keep this seemingly un-insulated pant a LOT warmer than it looks. 

2. LOOSE FIT for the win. I like to do the ""crouch-and-hug-a-ridgeline-test."" If you can do that comfortably in a pair of ski pants, you have a winner. These are winners. Also plenty of room for layers on those stupidly cold days. So they are versatile from -20F to 45F

3. Flattering fit. I HATE to admit this, but I actually do care how my pants look. I would still use these based on function and athletic fit alone, BUT,  it's a REALLY nice bonus that they happen to be flattering, too. i.e. lay flat across the stomach, and fall well off the rear and hips. The built-in belt is a huge help for customizing this fit as well. 

4. thighs vents - they are huge. You can dump heat instantly. 

5. Perfectly placed and sized pockets - 1 small pocket for ID/credit card tucked in near the waist, and 2 thigh cargo pockets large enough for a map. The left pocket also has a loop to attach your key to.

"Arc'teryx","Sentinel Pant - Women's","2432965",5,"I originally wanted to get the Stingray for color reasons, but the sizing on those were WAY off (the large barely fit). Like all the other ladies here, I found the Sentinel to be a much better fitting, much more flattering ski pant with more pockets to stash goodies in. I'm 5'4-ish"" (size 8) and the medium/regular fit perfect in the waist with spare room for layering. I will say that these run long though, even the regular version is about 2 inches too long. But, with boots/bindings, the length is just right and I'll just roll them up when walking around in shoes. These are SUPER cute, the pink tulip color is really fun, and are WAY comfy. It's  not easy finding a ""good ass pant"" in the ski aisle, and these do the trick!

OK - let's talk function since life is not always a fashion show! I've worn these a few times in 20-30 degree (F) weather so far with a single and double layer. They are perfectly warm and I'll likely use a thin + thick layer for wicked cold days. But what is the most impressive thing was my test in them yesterday, during what I swear was one of Utah's WETTEST snow storms ever. It was a day meant only for gor-tex, and these pants literally saved me from drowning like a wet rat at the resort in all the fabulous, albeit wet, snow. The wetness from the day worked it's sneaky way through my waterproof technical shell jacket, my waterproof leather gloves, and almost my ski boots. But my legs ... dry as a freakin' desert! I sat in puddles, I accidentally spilled my PBR on my pants, and I even played in the rain when I got back into the city. Legs. Remained.Dry!

I’m kind of a gear-head and have more jackets than I need in my rotation (just ask my wife). I’m normally size M and I got a size M in this one. I’ve had this jacket just over a year now.

WHAT: In a word, versatile. LT = light weight, add in the underarm gussets and stretchy materials and the shell just moves with you and doesn’t get in the way. It's durable, breathable and has great wind and water resistance (not water proof). 

WHEN: For me this is a 3-season shell, I use it as a stand alone jacket in the spring and fall but may partner it with a midlayer for winter activities. 

WHERE: I use this thing all over, hiking on the trail or going to the office in the city, this shell just works. And it packs down small enough to take with you wherever you go. We are traveling to NZ south island for a few weeks and this jacket is coming (along with my Beta LT). 

WHY: It's the best all-a-rounder, I have other jackets that do some things better but I haven't seen one that can do all these things this well.

STYLE: I love its look and feel. It has sleek simple lines with a perfect athletic cut. Add in this faint lined texture and the outer has an awesome feel. Note: I have a Gamma LT vest that's about 8 years old now and the new texture of the outer is really great. It's one of those things I didn't even know I needed. It's only drawback is the hood makes the collar stand out and look a little funny (I guess that's the price you pay for functionality).

FUNCTION: I “Needed” a good all-a-round jacket. I love to travel and do outdoor actives, so was looking for something have could handle almost any situation.

9 out of 10 
The collar with the hood is its only thing keeping this from being perfect. 
If you're like me and don't like hoods on anything other than a rain shell then the you'll be happy to know the non-hoody version of this jacket gets a 10 out of 10 in my book. 

Gamma LT vs Gamma MX
I have to say I've wanted a MX for over 10 years now. It's a really cool jacket, but the price always kept it just out of reach.
Quick match up: the MX wins on the cool factor, those extra chest pockets really set it apart from other players in this field and the extra warmth is nice if you're looking to not have to layer (although this was a downside for me living in a warmer climate). Ultimately it was the LT that came from behind and won this match up for me. The LT just fits my life better. The lightweight makes it better for traveling and just a bit more versatile. FYI: I did opt for the Hoody version due to a sale.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-14 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

One nice feature is is the stretchy cuffs made from a more slippery fabric.  The wrists are a high abrasion area and that fabric allows for better interplay between other fabrics (like on your gloves or mittens).  That same fabric is used in the hood, as well, which saves some weight.

"Arc'teryx","Gamma LT Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","492096",4,"I wanted a jacket to do three things: wear dayhiking, snowshoeing and for casual wear.  I previously had a US Army issue softshell until I learned I could sell it for $250+. That jacket had the best softshell material I’ve ever used and if it had been better sewn and not in Army, foliage green, I would have kept it.  
I replaced it with a Marmot ROM that I had for the past year.  It was well built, but boxy and I really didn’t need a jacket that “heavy” with the Gore Windstopper liner.  
 In buying the Gamma LT, I was concerned that it would be too tight in the arm holes, which seems to be a concern for me in other jackets.  I’m not a big guy, but am fit at 5”09” and 185lbs.  The jacket fits great and I can easily layer a base, then a light fleece or sweatshirt.  I can even fit a light puffy under it, but that does start to push the limits of the arm holes.  I ordered a large, but should have also ordered an XL to try on, then returned the one that didn’t fit as well. 
The sleeves are long, but that’s good and prevents them from riding up if you need to reach for something.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the cuffs are not adjustable but seem to be set for where I would if they had Velcro.  As a personal preference, I would still like to be able to adjust my own cuffs as sometime you just need to tighten them down and other times you might want to increase the airflow.  
The body of the jacket is lean which is nice if you’re wearing a pack or moving through brush.  I would prefer to have a little more room so that anything I wear on my belt, including a phone or knife, would not so easily print through the jacket when it’s zipped up.  The back of the jacket is nicely longer than the front, but again I would prefer just another inch of length in front, so that my fleece that’s hanging out isn’t getting wet.  
 The hood as also previously reviewed is very large, but can be cinched down to fit well without a helmet. 
The material itself is both very tough yet comfortable and stretches well.  I’ve had the chance to wear the jacket from below freezing in the 20’s up into the mid’50’s.  The jacket sheds light rain very well, but does start to wet out after 30 or so minutes.  I’ve remained dry underneath, but you just have to remember the limits of the material. I do very much like how breathable it is though.  Just to be clear, there is no lining, backing material or insulation on the interior.

"Arc'teryx","Gamma LT Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","2257255",5,"The Arc'teryx Gamma LT Hoody is one of the most versatile softshells on the market by perfecting what is required for a softshell. The Gamma LT Hoody was meant for the alpine and has all the features you need and nothing you don't. ""A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."" - Antoine de Saint-Exupery. The Gamma LT Hoody will be my main layering piece on any volcano climbs in the PNW during the summer.I'm 5'10"" and roughly 165lbs with 33"" waist and the Gamma LT Hoody is sized to accommodate a midlayer comfortably like a Atom LT hoody or a mid-weight down sweater. 

Pros: 

Fantastic fit with options for layering underneath 
Highly wind resistant but breathes incredibly 
Great water-resistance and dries quickly 
Hood accommodates over sized helmets 
Velcro-less cuff makes layering easy 

Cons: 
A little pricey

"Arc'teryx","Gamma LT Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","6140771",5,"I purchased the Gamma LT Hoody in late winter after previously owning the Patagonia Guide Hoody.  I really liked the Guide Hoody initially, but there were several design elements I didn't care for.  For instance, I wear size medium and found the sleeves to be excessively long.  While this normally wouldn't be an issue, the Guide Hoody didn't have any method of managing the sleeve length via velcro straps or some type of cinch system.  That issue, coupled with the lack of breathability due to the interior fleece lining led me to look elsewhere for a solid softshell.  I'm pleased to say my search began and ended with the Gamma.  This shell is spectacular in each area the Guide Hoody lacked.  First, Arc'teryx conveniently addressed the previously noted sleeve issue by crafting the base of the sleeve using an elastic fabric that keeps the sleeves in place without the hassle of velcro straps.  They used the same excellent design element on both my Atom LT Jacket and Atom SV Hoody to great affect.  The exterior fabric of the Gamma is made using the Arc'teryx Burly Weave, and it feels bomber.  I have full confidence I can rub the jacket against any surface without causing any wear to the fabric.  It feels super durable, but is also soft to the touch.  Given the durability, when I first received the jacket I thought it wouldn't be that breathable, and I was completely wrong.  The Gamma breathes better than any other layer I own and it is now my three season go-to piece for most outdoor pursuits.  ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-04-29 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Arc'teryx","Gamma LT Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","4323403",5,"For winter, I spend most of my time wearing this jacket. It's the most versatile jacket I've ever owned.

The fit: I am 6'2"", 170lbs and surprisingly bought a small. I can fit an UL down jacket/expedition baselayer underneath. Sleeve length and overall length is great. Size up for more layering options.

Things I've used this jacket for:
Bike commuting in town, snow cave building, snowshoeing, glisadding, shooting, lots of hiking.

Conditions I've used this jacket in: extreme wind, sub zero temps (with a puffy underneath), immersed in powder, wet and dry snow, heavy rain.

Features:
- Huge helmet compatible hood. In high wind, it blows off your head if it's not sinched down. The front of the hood extends far over your head, almost like a hat (which is good during active snowfall). The hood has two draw cords on the side to make it tighter and a rear draw cord to make it tighter-er (?). The bill of the hood is semi-stiff.
- Two huge hand pockets. Mesh lined, easily fit a pair of gloves and a hat in one pocket. There is also an internal chest pocket which fits a phone (no headphone port).
-Two draw cords at the bottom which can be operated with one hand.
-Wind guard behind the main zipper. The hand pockets have a much tighter zipper to keep wind out, but no wind guard. The main zipper has large teeth, is very easy to move, and has a large pull tab.
-Slight drop-tail in the back of about 1-2 inches.
-Cuffs have elastic panel (no velcro)

If I am working vigorously, I won't wear this jacket in temperatures over 30 degrees unless it's windy. Standing still, I am find down to mid 30's with it and just a T-Shirt. Breathability is good compared to any hardshell, but it's a windproof softshell which is limiting.

The outer face sheds snow well. The first places to get wet seem to be behind the neck and upper shoulders for some reason. It stays drier than a windshirt or DWR treated puffy. It does okay in the rain but don't expect it to serve as a rainshell.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-02-26 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Arc'teryx","Gamma LT Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","5492741",4,"This jacket is great for what it is.  A lighter weight, stretch woven, minimally featured softshell. It's great for active pursuits in cold weather.  I've had it out backpacking and hiking and it's just what I wanted.  The fabric appears very durable, but it results in a weight penalty for sure.  I'd say it's highly wind resistant, but definitely not windproof.  The upside is that it is very breathable if you're working hard.  The elastic cuffs and hem draw cord keep the wind out.  The hood is the typical head swallowing ""helmet compatible"" type but the adjustments work well to tailor the fit.   My one complaint is that the hood drawstrings sit inside the jacket, so to adjust you have to unzip; more of a personal inconvenience than a real flaw.  The two hand pockets are mesh lined and extend from below the armpits to the waist and can double as vents.  The pockets are completely accessible with a pack on. 
I'm 6' broad shoulders and the large fits perfect.  It is a true athletic cut and I could get a baselayer and maybe another light layer under it.   Puffy is a no go for me in the arms.
In the end, I don't think I'd pay full price.  Wait for a coupon or sale on this one; still a good piece, just not full price great.

I have not tried the extreme parkas from other brands but Ceres is definitely the warmest piece in Arcteryx line up. If you feel the 225g of Down in Ceres is not enough you can always double up by wearing Cerium SV (185g of Down) as a mid layer.

My wife is 5'6"" and normally wears a 12-14; the XL fit perfectly.

The jacket has a very feminine cut, with pronounced taper at the waist and a bell at the hip--a very flattering cut.  The fabrics are typical Arcteryx top-notch quality.  The jacket is also relatively warm and reasonably windproof.  The hood is also a very nice cut for casual use, with or without a hat.

The downsides?  The sleeves terminate with just the down--no cuff, no velcro, no wrist gaiter.  That lets the cold in.

That's about it for downsides.

As far as warmth goes, this is a mid-level down jacket.  There are many jackets in this realm, including the common North Face puffs and others like it.  This jacket is not as warm as the super-thick Canada Goose jackets, nor as warm as something like the Arcteryx Ceres.  But much of the time, those jackets would be overkill for casual use.

If you're cross shopping this against something like the North Face puffies (my wife had one that we were working to replace), the Arcteryx has a far better fit and cut, and higher quality fabrics that lock in the down.

 It's rather tightly fitted so not great for big busted gals or if you want to wear big bulky clothes under it.  

Unlike the Metro, the Nuri's design is stripped down with no way to adjust the hood, no inside chest pocket and no snap panel over the zipper.  That said, the hood fits well and my face is protected w/o wearing a scarf as it comes up over the chin when zipped all the way up.   You can see why there's no chest pocket because the material is so light it would pull down if there were a pocket and you put, say, a phone or wallet in it.

Super breathable so I don't swamp myself out, excellent quality construction that you would expect from a jacket in this price range.  This isn't a crazy slim fit, so I can see why some people say it runs large, but I am not a slim mountain climber type, so I felt that it fit quite true to size.

"Arc'teryx","Alpha AR Jacket - Men's","993825",4,"I bought this Alpha AR along with the Beta AR. I ended up keeping the Alpha over the Beta only because of the collar on the Beta. The collar is stiff and didn't want to lay down to me it was very annoying. I wish the Alpha had the fit of the Beta. The sleeves of the Alpha are a little baggy. The chest fits very well and the length is good. I'm just under 6 feet and 165 lbs. I wear a small as I find this jacket to run large. Backcountry recommended a medium but glad I went with a small. I can fit a down light jacket under it completely fine. I've recently had the opportunity to use this on a rainy hike. The hike was about 5-6 miles. It was not a strenuous hike, mild uphills with switch backs. The weather is typical southeast summer weather. Humid with the temps about 67-70. Rain was heavy at times but always falling steady. I was wearing a quick wick t-shirt and the same in hiking pants. The pace was about 2.5-3 miles per hour. This information to me is important to understand if the jacket really is breathable and well ventilated. At no point in my hike did I feel hot, and at the end I was not sweating. I never opened the vents however I do feel that on a more strenuous hike the vents would have needed to be used. The rain never reached the inside. It also did not show any signs of wetting out. 
Overall good jacket, breathes well, waterproofing works as designed. The fit could be slightly better. I would recommend that if you want a more athletic fit size down. Happy with the jacket. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-09-11 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""
"Arc'teryx","Alpha AR Jacket - Men's","107843551",4,"This is my first Arc'teryx product and I've eagerly awaited it's arrival. It's clearly a superior product in materials and craftsmanship, and it's light as a feather!

The only downsides I can seem to find are the fit, and the length of the sleeves.

As other reviews have stated, there is a lot of extra material in the shoulder areas, which is really a bummer. I'm 5'9, lean/athletic, 150lbs, and after pouring over the internet and getting help from a backcountry rep,I went for M size. I wasn't able to try one on beforehand because I'm currently living in Japan. I had to order it to the US and have it forwarded due to international shipping restrictions on the Arc'teryx brand.

The extra material in the shoulders only furthers the extra bunched look thanks to the length of the sleeves. I'll have more room to layer than I really need... The length of the jacket itself is great, the hood is a bit roomy, but that's easy to fix with the strap system. 

I am confident that even the Japanese rainy season will be no match for this jacket, and it will be a great companion in my winter trek through Hokkaido's national parks later this year. I only wish I had gone with an S size and wasn't stuck with a M due to international shipping/forwarding. Don't make the same mistake I did!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-06-23 00:00:00","",""
"Arc'teryx","Alpha AR Jacket - Men's","106599048",3,"I can relate to another review in this post regarding the sizing and fit of this jacket. First, I am a huge Arc'teryx fan and love the quality of their products. After doing much reading/research I took the plunge and purchased the Medium Alpha AR. No local retailer carries it, so I did not have a chance to try it beforehand.

This is a sharp looking jacket (on the hanger). The materials, construction and finish of this product were spot-on as you would expect for a ~$500 jacket. The issue arrises with the fit, there is entirely too much space/fabric around the shoulder areas of this jacket. At first I thought perhaps I just need to layer up and see how it fits. I put on a fleece and the Thorium AR jacket as base layers and tried again. Unfortunately, there were still bunches of material around shoulder area of this jacket. There is a fine line between having enough material for unimpeded movement in the shoulder/upper arm area versus it being excessive - for this jacket it falls in the later.

I have a lean/fit climbers build - the body fit seems on par, the arm length is on the long side (and I have long arms) but I would expect this with this style of jacket, but the shoulder ""situation"" is just excessive. I cannot think of a good design reason for there to be so much room/fabric in this area of the jacket. If I turned into the raging Hulk is might be good fit(?)

I am returning this jacket and will likely get the Alpha SV. I am familiar with the Alpha SV and it does not have the baggy shoulder situation going on. As another reviewer pointed out, the Alpha SV has a more true athletic fit then this jacket.

Sharp, well made jacket, just seems to have a ""wonky"" fit.

Now I just have to wait for another 20% coupon to get the SV!

I’ve used it for everything from downpours to blizzards in the mountains and it’s kept me dry for just about all of it. When I first got it I wore it in a storm in Dutch Harbor, AK after about an hour I noticed the water had stopped beading up and it just looked like the melted snow was soaking into the top layer of the Gore-Tex. I was still dry inside the shell but I was a little puzzled. The next time I wore it in the rain I watched the top layer soak up the water again. I wasn’t ready to give up on it and just figured I got the 1 in a 100 jacket that makes for a 1 star review, so I treated it with Nikwax. After treatment the water beaded right off the jacket and I have only wet out once but that was on a backpacking trip in Seward and it was pouring the whole time. Other than that speed bump this is a great shell. It breathes well, has room for layering while not being too bulky, all the futures are well thought out and perform great, and if you’re like me and run hot the pit zips are indispensable.

To give others reference, I am 5'9"" with a 44"" chest and broad shoulders and found the L to fit me almost perfectly.  An extra inch or two in the chest would be nice for my torso, but it would not be worth the extra sleeve or waist lengths in the XL.   There is zero restriction in the shoulders when moving my arms in any manner.  Also, there are definitely 3 hood cords for adjustments.  Overall, this is as close to a custom fit jacket as I could probably ask for.

I choose the Alpha AR after doing online research only (no local retailers carry this), and it has exceeded my expectations.  The new GoreTex Pro fabric is incredibly lightweight and bomber in the elements...the exact specs I needed for the demands of hiking in the ADK's year-round.

"Arc'teryx","Alpha AR Jacket - Men's","2432191",3,"When I ordered this jacket i had high expectations. I really liked the idea of a light weight hardshell that could still take a beating. I had used an older alpha SV from arcteryx for many years and it was superb. The cut, features, and detail were all spot on.
Unfortunately I can not say the same of the Alph AR. Here is why:
First, the cut is not the same, ""tailored"" fit the Alpha SV, and almost all other arcteryx pieces have. It is a bit too baggy in the arms, creating extra folds, while being a bit too constricting in the shoulders/upper chest area. At the same time, the area from the chest down seems to be a bit too baggy. This cut, doesn't really help layering, while adding a lot of material. 
Second problem: the hood only has 2 way adjustability! No 3 way fore-aft adjustability! At this level I thought 3 way adjustability was a foregone conclusion. 
Overall this is probably still a good jacket for most people. But for everyone who is going to be using this jacket day-in and day-out these things will get annoying real fast.
Overall I'd give this a 3.5 stars, but since I can't I''m going with 3.

I don't know how so many reviewers are saying these shrink; they're a nylon/poly blend of fabric. I've washed and dried mine dozens of times over the past 6 months and they stay the same size & length. Having said that, they are like nearly all of the Arc'Teryx hiking/climbing pants, which is to say that they seem to run about 1/2 to 3/4"" short in length. This is great to keep them out of the way for outdoor pursuits, but they do tend to look a bit 'high-water' for urban adventures. For the sleek look and comfort, though, I don't mind terribly, but if they were available in a 33"" length I'd choose those. 

These are also an 'athletic fit', meaning they're pretty slim. I have an 'endurance' build and these don't leave me a lot of room. They're not tight, but if I were to miss a couple weeks of training they could get that way. Definitely not made for guys who spend their gym hours at the squat rack.

"Arc'teryx","Beta SL Jacket - Men's","109722616",5,"I’ve had the jacket only for a few days. I bought it for daily commuting and casual use, but also intend to take it bike touring, camping, and hiking. This was highly rated on several third party rating websites for overall performance in being a rain shell. During the time I’ve owned it I’ve cycled through rain on a 65 degree day, and walked to work on a windy 32 degree day (Chicago’s temperature dropped 30 degrees in 12 hours). 

On the 65 degree rainy day, this jacket was very effective. My torso stayed dry, and the hood is large enough to fit over my helmet which is a huge plus. The hood overall is very nice and fits better than any other rain jacket / shell I’ve owned. Its three adjustment points let you fint-tune how much it covers your head and face. It was also effective in dumping excess heat while riding and wearing business casual clothes under it.

On the 32 degree windy morning, the jacket was very effective at blocking wind, and when paired with a sweater underneath I was not cold, though I’ve yet to test it in prolonged cold situations.

What’s great is that both Arc’Teryx and Gore provide quality guarantees on the product, though I have not had to use them yet. It’s machine washable and dryable, the company recommends doing this regularly. The jacket is very light and packable, and feels very much like a thin shell with no padding. I am 5’6” wearing a small and the fit is good through the waist, though the arms are slightly baggy. The construction feels very solid, every seam is sealed. The range of motion is great through the arms. The only awkward part is the pocket placement, which are to accommodate backpacking waist straps, though in casual wear are a little high to rest your hands in.

So far so good, looking forward to using this jacket to its potential.","EMPLOYEE","2017-12-05 00:00:00","I gave it as a gift but have feedback to share",""

+ Waterproof zipper is super easy and glides effortlessly with one hand. 
+ Hook-and-loop cuffs and hem drawcord work great and are much appreciated when the weather calls for them.
+Good color options. I went with the Masago for visibility while on the bike or walking/running in the woods during hunting season in the mountains. Humored that the color is named after fish eggs, too.

"Arc'teryx","Beta SL Jacket - Men's","3820935",5,"I've had this jacket for several months now, and feel like I can finally offer a review of it.  I own this and the Alpha SL Hybrid, which I believe has been discontinued, but I'll compare it anyways.  

First, I have both jackets in size medium.  I'm about 5'10"" 165, they fit me with a little bit of room to layer, but still fit well and look good just over a t shirt.  The fit is almost identical, the Alpha SL might be just a tad roomier, but not enough to notice.

Both are incredibly waterproof and windproof, no problems there, and the feel of the fabric is great.  For some reason I feel like the Alpha fabric is a bit tougher and the Beta a bit softer, but it could be just the color, in my head, or who knows.   Both feel bombproof.

There are a few things I really love about the Beta over the Alpha:
--The hood--it's not massive for a helmet, which I rarely use with this jacket, and fits SO much better on my dome.
--Pockets--on the Alpha, the pockets are a bit too high, they make walking with your hands in them crappy.  Beta placement is good, out of the way of a hip belt or harness, and still good for hands in pockets.

What I like about the Alpha over the Beta:
--PIT ZIPS! why are they not on the Beta?
--Vislon zipper rules.  Doesn't snag, feels so much nicer.

Overall, if I had to choose one, I'd probably go with the Alpha hybrid, because of the zipper and pit zips.  But it's nice to have both for different reasons.  I'm sure during summer Atlanta rainstorms, the Alpha SL will win (pit zips!), or if I wear one climbing or anything with a helmet.  The Beta is more of a throw-it-on-over-a-hoodie-for-wind-and-rain-protection piece for me, and it excels.

Next test was Dillingham, where it was blowing 30-40 and raining for 4 days straight, again, it kept me dry except for those few spots around the neck/wrists where it wasn't completely sealed.

I've used it mostly for gym climbing so far, but it's been really awesome.  I'd recommend it to just about anyone! Very lightweight, thin and not at all bulky, I love the non-adjustable leg loops.  This may be my perfect harness.

I also work in a gym, so I'm often belaying for long periods of time, and I've ended up wearing this harness for 6+ hours just because it was so comfortable that I didn't feel like taking it off!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-24 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Arc'teryx","FL-355 Harness - Women's","3038609",3,"I have been using the R280 from 2008 forever and love love love it. Not sure when the sizing changed but there are 2 major problems that would easily be fixed. 1. New models do not have a waist strap that is long enough. I have narrow hips, this would be so much worse if they were normal or large. I have the small and I can barely squeeze my hips through the harness (often I just unbuckle it). I cinch it down as tight as it goes, so a medium would be too big in the waist although it would be easier getting over my hips. The issue here is having to unbuckle the strap, not a great thing as when rebuckling if a mistake is made it could be fatal. Please, please make this strap longer! Yes it might flap around but that is insignificant to fitting well. The R280 has 4 "" longer. 2. The leg straps are not long enough. I am somewhat long waisted, so perhaps this does not affect alot of women. The leg loops ride up to my crotch which is incredibly uncomfortable after about 10 minutes belaying. A 2 week trip climbing daily left me with bruises around my crotch. Another 2-3"" of extension on the leg loops would allow this to fit almost any body type. Cross posting in hopes of getting the engineers' attention, I do not want to switch to another harness--these are the absolute best when they fit right :) ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-14 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

I wear a small in Black diamond harnesses, and originally tried a small in another Arcteryx harness, and was bummed to find that it fit a bit tight around the thighs and almost too small around the waste. I probably could have made it work, but my thighs were a bit too muscular for comfort in the small.  Got a medium and fits much better, although may be a bit larger around the waste.  Chronic problem. For comparison, I wear a size 8 in arcteryx pants, but a 6 in most other brands.

Great for hot days and long approaches, and doesn't start hurting if you're working a move and falling over and over.  

I use this for cragging, alpine climbing and canyoneering.  I can fit two thin layers under the leg loops (wool long undies and hiking pants) if needed.  I have a different harness for ice climbing and mountaineering when I need thicker layers and/or the ability to put my harness on while wearing crampons.

"Arc'teryx","Darrah Insulated Coat - Women's","108808155",5,"As a Cape Cod resident, I needed a lightweight but warm winter coat that would help me during my short, rural commute and also be useful for long walks through conservation lands or on the beach. I purchased this coat before Thanksgiving and it's been perfect so far. I have worn it down to 15/20 degrees and 15-20 mph winds; also 30ish, damp rainy days. I do not get overheated while wearing it on car rides but still find it very warm outside (and wear it with layers on colder days).

The one small issue is the zipper as others have mentioned. It's sometimes a bit difficult to get the zipper to engage and close, but I have found that I just need to make sure it's fully 'seated' or 'engaged' before zipping. This has been an issue for me with several other well known brands of parkas, so I'm thinking it's a general zipper issue and not related to this brand.

I love this coat and found the shopping experience to be extremely quick and easy. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-04 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Arc'teryx","Darrah Insulated Coat - Women's","108951112",4,"I tried this coat in a small in Carbon Copy color.  It was a great color and I liked that there was a little multi-grey pattern/texture to the material, making it look more feminine and sophisticated.  It seemed more durable than the typical soft, thin fabric of down parkas.
The hood was a good size (I have a slightly larger head than average) but not detachable.  The collar came up to a good height (upper lip).  The interior of the collar did not have a soft lining.
The sleeves seemed a little bit long on me, but I usually wear petite in long sleeves.  They were not unlivable.  I liked how the sleeve ends were longer where the thumb side of the hand is.  A nice tailored touch for added warmth.  The upper arms seemed bulky.  The chest felt tight at the smallest part of the A-line cut, about 2"" below the bra line.  If you are thicker here, or wearing several layers, you may find it tight here.
The pockets are only lined with warm material in the fronts, probably to reduce bulk.  The zipper lies a little funky--oscilating in and out from the torso.
I don't consider this coat to be in the ""warmest"" category of parkas.  Definitely warmer than thin coats and down sweaters, but if you have very cold weather (10's and 20's F) and get cold easily or are standing in one place for a long time, I don't think this would cut it.  You might have to layer up.

Seems like such an obvious market gap). Super excited for these when I saw them hit Arc'teryx's website.  But the sizing. Oh the sizing... The waist actually was fine for me and it's the same waist found in their Soleus running shorts which are my all time fave. But the crotch and quads are very tight. I feel like I'm a fairly lean guy, maybe a bit more muscular in the hips, glutes, and quads than the average Joe but aren't all skiers? It's not like I squat 400+ lbs or anything. And these just didn't leave any room for normal athletic movement. Ironically, you'd need tree trunk calves for the boot cuff to be an issue. Also, as others have noted, the crotch zip is way too small and pretty much useless. Anyway, returned the M and bought a size L and the waist was too baggy and the quads were still tight, although manageable. The drawstring was pretty ineffective though and I just did some light air squats at home and could feel them riding down my behind under my bibs. Just wasn't in the cards I guess. Shame, great material, boot cuff, and waist. Pocket was a good size and location. Hopefully, they tweak the cut as it's far from 'athletic'. I have about 5 pairs of various bottoms from Arc, all M or 32 and this is the first time I've ever had an issue. Even their Alpha Comp which claims to be a 'Trim' fit in the M fits me well, I love those pants, so it was very strange / disappointing about the Axino. So close.

11/30/15 - My fellow Expert Gearhead Geoff Connor picked me up early to head up Little Cottonwood and lucky for us conditions were looking fantastic (at least in the higher elevations).

I am a short (5' 7""), out of shape (~200lbs) guy who lives in the city and goes to the snow twice a year.  This jacket is not being used for it's ""intended"" or ""designed"" purpose. I ordered both the L and XL.  I returned the L because it would be great if I was going to climb or do hiking in the snow but that wasn't the fit I wanted for my around town casual use.

The reasons I LOVE this jacket are the look, fit (except for arm length), and warmth/breathability.  It has the look and fit of something not super technical (since it got the XL) and not super baggy.  I have a hard time with that since I am shorter and fatter than your average reviewer here.  For me it is the perfect fit for an everyday jacket.  The arms are too long but the cuffs make it a non issue.  The warmth/breathability has been exactly what I was looking for.  I knew the upside/downside of softshells prior to purchase.  (know what you're getting if you've never bought one)  I can comfortably wear this on cooler summer nights and all day during the fall and spring here in Yokosuka, Japan.  It's heavier/not as breathable as the OR Ferrosi but lighter/more breathable than the North Face Apex Boinic.

I am 6' and 165 pounds and have a 38"" chest.  I went with the size large and I think it was definitely the right call as the jacket sizes small in my opinion.  With the large, it is not too big / roomy with nothing but a base layer underneath and it has enough room to put a small / medium fill down layer underneath.   Also, it is highly wind and water resistant, and the look and feel / texture of the jacket is absolutely amazing.  In addition, the cut is superb (allows for great freedom of movement), the pockets are well designed (zippers are perfect and pocket sizing is robust), and the color really pops to make it an instant favorite.

"Arc'teryx","Gamma MX Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","465988",4,"Overall, I've been really pleased with the Gamma MX Hoody. I like all the pockets, although one (left) chest pocket would have been sufficient (in addition to the handwarmer pockets). Also, my sleeve pocket doesn't get much use. The handwarmer pockets are large, with a large zippered opening. The hood fits reasonably well with a knit cap underneath. The hood is sized for a helmet, but it can be snugged up adequately when wearing just a knit cap.

I had a Gamma MX jacket in size medium from a few years ago, and it was a bit too snug for my tastes (I couldn't layer with it). I purchased a size large in the Gamma MX Hoody, and I am happy with it. I am 5'10""+ and 165 pounds. The size large leaves room for a Patagonia Nano Puff or Down Sweater underneath, and the size large isn't a tent with thinner layers. The sleeves are really long, but better a bit too long than a bit too short. The cuffs are a bit tight (hard to get over your hands), but that's no big deal.

We frequently have a lot of wind where I live along the Colorado Front Range, so I usually wear a somewhat windproof base layer under the jacket (e.g., the Patagonia Nano Puff). It has been cold and windy since I got the jacket, so I have not yet had a chance to test it with a wind permeable mid-layer in calmer (non-windy) conditions.

Built quality seems to be first rate; we'll see how it does down the road. So far, I am enjoying the size large Gamma MX Hoody much more than my former Gamma MX jacket in medium. Cheers!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-11-24 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Arc'teryx","Bora2 Mid Backpacking Boot - Men's","663379910",3,"I got these boots about a month ago and have worn around my house a few times and taken out for two modest length hikes (6-8 miles on rough terrain)). My first impression is that they are awesome. They are REALLY LIGHT, almost 200 g per boot lighter than my favorite Asolo boots, the soles are very grippy on a wide variety of terrain and the narrow toe box is great for climbing and getting the boots into cracks and crannies on steep stuff. I haven't really been out in wet conditions yet so I can't comment on the waterproof qualities of the internal boots.

The big issue for me is heel blisters. I am pretty confident that the boot is properly fitted. I've tried in thin liner socks, low cut Iniji socks and bare foot (for a very short time - extremely uncomfortable).  It seems that where the rigid heel cup ends the bootie flexes and folds on the hard plastic of the heel plate and that fold rubs my heel. I  think this is possible because of the very soft and flexible outer shell.  I've tried wearing very loose, super tight and in between and I get a blister in the same spot every time. And oddly enough it is more of an issue on the better fitting boot. My other smaller foot does not have this problem despite fitting more loosely. (I should also point out that I've worn many brands of boots over the years and never got blisters in any of them). I'd be willing to bet if the bootie did not have the rigid sole for use without the shell I wouldn't be having this issue (which of course would also eliminate one of the product's benefits). Going to try with a regular hiking sock to see if that helps. Other than that they're very comfortable. And even though the toe box is narrow for whatever reason it really doesn't bother me with wider feet. I think the bootie helps with this by creating a somewhat ""custom"" fit, which was my hope when I bought them.

Other than that glaring issue the boots are great. I'm curious to see how the outer shell holds up over time with rough use. The materials seems very soft and pliable and I can't help but wonder if it will tear, puncture, etc. with rough use. I also noticed some stitching on the bootie already seems to be fraying a bit, which may be an issue with the waterproofing mentioned in another person's review. I'll have to monitor.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-09-29 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Arc'teryx","Bora2 Mid Backpacking Boot - Men's","108376884",5,"I've been using these boots on a couple different backpacking trips as my only shoes. Typically I bring a pair of boots or shoes, as well as a pair of sandals or flip flops for around camp. But with the removable liners that actually have rubber soles on them, I've been able to simply use those. Plus, when I wear them around on their own, they breathe better out of the boot and seem to dry off pretty quickly.

The boots do run a little narrower, so be careful on that for sizing. Other than that, they broke in very quickly for me, and they haven't had any pressure points or hot spots during the time that I've used them. 

As for practicality, the soles and versatility of the boots make them excellent for almost any terrain, they grip well, have great support, and break down with the liners to make an entirely separate pair of shoes. 

My only problem with the boots is that my liners seem to have either lost some waterproofing ability, or never had it in the first place. I'm noticing now, after around 100 miles put into the boots or so, that the liners will take in a little bit of water if fully submerged, but not to the point where the gore-tex ends. It's not enough to even notice at first, but I've noticed my socks are just a little damp when I take them off afterwords. Other reviews lead me to believe that this is caused by the stitching in the liner, but mine could also be isolated and only require a warranty claim. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend them. They dry incredibly fast, much faster than anyone's boots that went backpacking with me that didn't have liners, the removable liners are a necessity that I didn't even know I needed until I had them, and the overall quality of the boots is well worth the insane price tag.

Almost every through hiker i encountered had been through 3-5 pairs of shoes, waterproof and non waterproof, trail runner and sturdy boot, and every variation of trail footwear. Almost every experienced hiker told me DO NOT WEAR WATERPROOF FOOTWEAR. Here's the reality of long distance hiking. You are going to get wet, you will sweat in dry weather, and you will sweat in your fancy gore tex pro or pertex or event raingear. Period. You will get wet and you will have to accept it and deal with it, which is why experienced hikers wear non waterproof footwear, which is more breathable and will dry faster than any pair of waterproof boots. I don't care what they are made of or how expensive they are, it is foolish to believe you will not sweat and that you will be perfectly dry in stormy weather(or even dry weather), or that they will dry out overnight. The key to happy dry feet is to stay at home and wear your favorite pair of slippers. But for those who do endurance hiking and spend months on the trail, they know the key to happy dry-ish feet is to wear a pair of footwear that will let your feet breath and can dry out quickly when they get wet, a.k.a. anything without a waterproof membrane. I'm not just speaking about these boots in particular, im speaking about every boot. ""But these are gore-tex they will breath, and they have a removable liner so they will dry out overnight."" I thought the same thing as you, i wasn't experienced either. If you still think i'm wrong and believe these boots can defy the laws of hiking, go ahead and spend $350 for these, and maybe you'll learn a valuable lesson like i did. I wanted to love these boots, and i do, i just won't wear them for any extended trips until Arcteryx comes out with a non gore-tex liner.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-11-25 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

. I took the leap and would gladly do it again! I love just about everything about the boot. The removable liner has come in handy a few different times around camp to use a slipper, or even cold nights it can act as a bootie. To this point too, is the insulated liner that is available separately. Now the boot is extended to be used almost year round. The vibram sole has great traction, even on the wet rocks of the Adirondacks that I used them on several times.

The only minor issues I have experienced with these, was the first speed hook can actually do its job too good. When untying, my laces have gotten stuck and takes a bit of some pulling the get the lace out. The only other thing, was that I have some above average wide feet, so the first few times wearing them, right below my ankles would start to hurt. I would loosen the laces and then would be fine, and this pattern ceased after maybe 3 times using them on very short hikes during the break in period.

The fit was true to size for me. I typically am an 11 in majority shoe brands, and was the same case here too. I didn't experience any blistering with these boots at all, however, I am not typically one to get blisters from new footwear.

Boots look very sharp, seem well made and fit true to size. I love how light they are compared to leather boots. I always feel sad for my friends with bulky heavy boots. Vibram soles work well as expected,v ery grippy and good all around.

The best part is the removable liner, I dont know if it conforms to your foot etc but, being able to take them out as a camp shoe, to dry, to wash etc is just so darn practical. 

I've spent all day walking through snow and my foot stayed dry. I noticed some wetness in the liner after finally removing them but it didnt make it through to my foot. Yeah! Also the liner dries quickly once taken out. 

Also, the fact that the shoes have no tongue I find to be a huge benefit.

Moderately warm - my last fleece was an R2, and the Patagonia was warmer (under a shell, at least - the R2 was not water or wind resistant at all, plus it was so furry looking, to the point that I hardly ever wore it alone).

Fits just perfect, not baggy at all (as I saw others complain). Sleeves length is as it should be, as is the overall length. I've put on a little weight over the last year from 5.11 and 185 to about 200#, but cannot say the fit is worse, just a little tighter, as expected. 
While hiking, I used this as my main jacket over a short sleeve T. Found it held surprisingly well against mild breezes and easily down in the high 30s. It only works if you move. If you expect this to keep you warm while sitting down waiting for sunrise, you will be disappointed. It's not what it is meant for. But throw a light hybrid shell on top (like the Alpha Comp) and you will be surprised how well it holds. 
The built in hood comes in incredibly useful while skiing. I had a Gore Bike wear head/face mask I used before and was curious how well does this hold. And it does great. While it really doesn't have the wind resistance of the Gore, so it won't be useful in extreme cold with gale strength winds, for regular skiing purposes it's just perfect. I use the Fortrez over a REI merino base and under a Procline Hybrid and it did great down to 5F. Below that I had to change plans...
As far as resistance of the fabric... I washed it at least 15-20x and it still feels and looks as new. No piling. No loss of anything. No holes.

The fleece material was also much thinner than I expected, leaving me with a beautiful piece of clothing that barely keep me warm. If it is below about 55 degrees outside and even the slightest bit windy I need to layer considerably over this particular fleece.

If you are looking for something a little thicker, try the Arenite or Straibo.

I wear this while working outside in the winter (carpentry) with a Smartwool baselayer and a $20 softshell jacket to take the abuse. This setup is fine for anything above 15F, if it gets colder I add a NorthFace Thermoball jacket. The balaclava was awesome last week when when windchill dropped below. Haven't noticed it when I'm not using it, in fact I forgot about it until I my face was numb and I needed a fix. I've been wearing this for 2 weeks straight and as another review said, I don't ever want to take it off. Took it for a hike on a 40F day with a little wind. It seemed to block a reasonable amount of wind which was surprising. The hardface is great, looks brand new still.

-Fit for cycling - this fleece honestly fits very similarly to what you might expect from a made-for-cycling piece of apparel, which I found surprising. In the context of cycling, this is my favorite midlayer.

Things I don't like:
-Fit for other things - Unfortunately, I can't say that I'm particularly thrilled about how this jacket fits for activities off of a bike. Ironically, I purchased this more for use climbing. What I have found is that the shoulders are too restricted to be very comfortable for activities like climbing that require a lot of overhead arm movement. If you're staying relatively still, the fit is great, but once you start moving your upper body a lot, it feels restrictive.

In sum, I definitely am a fan of this piece, and would likely buy it again, simply because it's so good for bicycle commuting. That said, it's not as much of a knock-out piece as one typically expects from Arc'Teryx, and I think it actually falls a little short for its intended purpose.

Most people I know use the theta, which has rather slim legs. I've compared the stinger with the theta head to head in the store (doing squats), and it was obvious that the stinger, with their spacious legs, gives a much better freedom for movement.

Another issue I have with the theta is that there's too few and too small pockets. It's great to have quick access to snacks, gloves, cap, camera, etc.. etc... You are more likely to be wearing a shell pant than a jacket when you're ascending, so pockets on the jacket don't cover this for me. If you're in a group, it's very nice to be able to fetch out some snacks without having to stop and halt the people behind you. The stinger has all the pockets you'll ever need, huge thumb up.

I therefore find it extremely frustrating that Arcteryx have dropped the full zippered legs on the stinger. It's so close to being the perfect shell pants for skiing, but this flaw ruins everything. A good ventilated pant can be worn on the way up, even in the spring. The stinger can not. The ventilation zipper is way to short to give decent flow-through for when the going gets tough. And if you're wearing a jacket, the little slit that's left for ventilation becomes a joke. Combine this with not being able to put these on without having to take off your ski boots and you got a problem. Too warm to wear them up, and too much trouble putting them on once you're on the top. I find myself having to plan when to put them on (lunch-break) and then just live with being drenched in sweat for the last part of the ascent. 

I can't live with this anymore. I won't be jumping off a cliff, but I will have to find another go to pant for my winter activity. So close to being perfect. Extremely frustrating. Really hope Arcteryx sort this out for next season. Don't understand all those pockets and the spacious legs, if they're only aiming for the ski resort users.. Makes no sense to me.

"Arc'teryx","Stinger Bib Pant - Men's","2958628",2,"I had very high expectations for these bibs. I purchased the first pair in 2014 and wore them for half a season. They seemed a perfect, light-weight option for the limited boot-packing I was doing off the lift.
 Then at some point in March 2014 the pants started to wet out. I noticed the seat of my pants were wet and figured I had left a zipper open or snow had somehow slid down the back of my jacket and into my pants. I checked everything and found no gaps or openings. I was in shock. I couldn't believe an item of this stature would fail.
I decided to ski them one more day, largely because I was in disbelief. I took them out the following day and experienced exactly the same thing, so I contacted Arcteryx and initiated the return process (Arcteryx return policy is the reason these bibs receive any stars in my review). Arcteryx staff was quite helpful and my return was processed quickly, unfortunately, they were out of this item, so I waited until 2015 to replace my pants.

I got my new bibs in August, sent them to Rainy Pass Repairs in Seattle,  and waited for snow.

First day out this year, December, and the very same thing. Wet in the seat of the pants on the first day, and to top it off, I spent an extra 150 having these tailored by Rainy Pass.

 I have to think there is something wrong with the materials used in this pant. I own several other Arcteryx items and have used Arcteryx pants and jackets extensively and not had any complaints. There is something seriously flawed with this bib.

"Arc'teryx","Stinger Bib Pant - Men's","623567110",4,"For bib-lovers, these are a great option for resort riding.  The mid height bibs are great for providing more protection on deep days, but not a full chest height bib that can be too hot on warmer days.  Another great feature of the bib is that these have a very light elastic ""cuff"" thru the waist, so when you want to take off the suspenders, there's enough hold there to keep the pants from falling down.  

The gore text pro is amazing for storm riding - nothing penetrates it.  Even though these are a bomber shell, they're remarkably lightweight.  In that sense, they're a great compliment to the Arc'teryx Rush jacket. 

My only qualms with the Stinger Bibs is are the pockets and the cut of the bottom cuff opening.  The pockets up on the bib are really small and not gusseted at all, making them useless for anything but small stuff like chapstick.  And even then, because the pocket is so tight, it's hard to fish the chapstick out. 

As for the bottom cuff, it seems to ride up my ski boots a little bit (see photo). It's just a little bit of ride up, which I think it caused by the articulation in the knee.  Not a big deal but in a perfect world they would stay down a bit. 

Overall, these are great Bib and I highly recommend them. I'm 5'11"" and a slender 150lbs and a Medium fits pretty well.  Maybe if they were slightly longer I wouldn't have that ride-up problem. Otherwise the fit is great.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-11-22 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Arc'teryx","Stinger Bib Pant - Men's","4767678",5,"I got these to replace an old pair of Patagonia Primo pants. It's been tough to find good hardshell pants with suspenders (not a belt) to keep the freedom of movement for both backcountry and resort skiing. What an upgrade these are. I'm 6'1"", 175 lbs and got a Large. The fit is loose, but by no means baggy. Plenty of room to get full leg bends and not feel like you're going to bust a seam, but not enough fabric that it flaps around when you're ripping down the trails. The waist stretches plenty, and the bib has some room to spare for layering underneath. I have a 34"" inseam and had no trouble with the length.

They seem durable so far, having survived a fair amount of New England tree skiing without a scratch. I was worried the fabric wouldn't be breathable enough for touring, but I've yet to use the thigh vents up to about 30F. The loose fit helps a lot with air circulation on the way up.

The bib pockets are the perfect size for a phone and wallet when riding lifts, though they sit under the waist belt of my day pack, which is a bit of a pain for touring. I don't put much other than a facemask in the thigh pockets, but they're plenty big enough to keep a map or pair of gloves. The two-way front zipper is also handy for relieving yourself.

"Arc'teryx","Stinger Bib Pant - Men's","4188264",2,"After extensive research on these pants and positive remarks by Blister Gear review, I decided to pull the trigger. 

Fabric:
Out of the box the N80Pp-X fabric felt much more supple than expected, but still rugged.  The Keprotec instep and Cordura cuff add durability for climbing with crampons, though it would be nice to see the fabric go an inch higher and wider for added protection. 

**Update: After 22 days of use the buttox region blew out in a big 3"" tear along the seam. They were not sliced by a rock or any sharps. 

Features + Fit:
The waterproof zippers work well. With three zippers each you can very easily open or close them for dumping heat or if nature calls. The storage pockets on the chest are perfectly sized for batteries, headlamps, multi-tools etc. The leg pockets are cavernous and accommodate gloves very nicely. The suspenders adjust easily and can accommodate a wide variety of heights, but the pants are geared towards tall slender folks. Personally the athletic fit through the torso was not an issue for me, but is something to consider if you have a few extra pounds or are broad. 

Performance:
In good weather these pants perform very well. Zippers do not ice up and they do not ride up like other bib pants. I switched back to Gore-Tex for harsh weather waterproof  performance in the snow, sleet, and freezing rain while skiing, digging snowpits, mountaineering, etc. Storm riding lift serviced laps the pants wet out after a few hours and I was left cold and wet the rest of the day.  At first I thought it was a fluke, but every wet day in the mountains so far this year I've come home wet. This wet out is due to a change in the DWR coating used and is a known issue. It can be refreshed with normal washing, but is not as resilient.

Bottom Line:
These pants have better features and a better fit than any pant I've owned, but the waterproofing technology needs refinement. Durability suspect.

I got the bibs not too long ago so can't comment on durability. I've used this a few times in April on some wet storm days, skiing on a mix of snow, wet snow and also rain, as you would expect from Gore Pro Shell it's totally waterproof and excellent on beading water!
I'm 5,5"" ~147lbs somewhere between 30 and 32 waist and 30 inseam and the small fits me perfectly, the fit is not so generous above the waist area like the powslayer but it's not restricting, it's a nice snug fit, legs are less relaxed but still good room for layering, I could fit either a merino baselayer or a fleece pants for really cold days. It looks a little longer compared to the powslayer, but I'm not really sure.
The pockets configuration is great for me, the two upper pockets are small, but useful and they don't make the bibs part bulky, I would put things like money and cc for apres, ID and things like that, since they are not really easy to reach if you are wearing jacket and pack, I prefer to put stuff I grab more frequently during my day on my jacket pockets. The two lower pockets are big enough for a balaclava, glove liners, neck gaiter or other things like that, maybe a trail map if you are skiing inbounds in a place you are not used to.
Venting is great, two big side zipper venting that go from the top of the bibs to around the knees, the best is that it's a triple not dual zippers, so you can play with it, you don't need to open all the way to the top of the bibs to vent and you don't have zippers hidden bellow your jacket! The drop seat seems practical and easier to use compared to the powslayer.

Pros: 

- First and foremost, the biggest pro of these is how waterproof they are. They rock and have dealt with high moisture content snow and they didn't bat a Gore Tex eye. 

- The pros on the cut on this pants are definitely that its a mid level bib and that they have full side zips.

When I am working, I use these bibs every day as rain pants in the rainforest of far western Washington (I am a forester and am in the woods 6 inches of rain or shine). Here are my notes:

Cons:

These bibs are not downpour proof. I have used many different brands to keep me dry in the woods in my career, and can easily recognize the difference between perspiration and leakage. When I wear these and it is really coming down, my crotch and knees get wet. The zippers and lightweight material were not designed to keep steady streams of water from penetrating the fabric and crotch zipper. I have owned <$100 hiking rain pants that have performed equally if not better in downpours, although these bibs are more durable.

After less than one year of use, I have developed two large holes, one on each cuff, from repeatedly kicking branch stobs and from ski edge abrasion. Please note that I am not necessarily holding this against the bibs because I fully understand that I use these things for some of the harshest off trail brush and slash travel as you can imagine. I have found the seam between the reinforced kickstep and the regular material to be the weak point.  

Pros:

The articulated knees and crotch are simply awesome. I can drag my long legs up and over downed logs and lift my knees as high as I need to without the slightest bit of bind or pressure.  These things are very comfortable and can be adjusted to fit exactly how you want them to. 

The breathability is better than I found with any other garment I have owned. I can be moving fast uphill all day without sweating through my cotton pants (other than the leakage points described above).

When I use these things for skiing, I am always impressed. The great breathability, flexibility and comfort make them a joy whether I am cruising down the groomers or skinning in a blizzard. I have yet to find a snow day where the rate of frozen precipitation is greater than the gore tex can shed, although when it rains, it is a different story. The inner gaiter keeps all snow out and prevents the bibs from riding up my leg while hiking.

The bottom line:

Used solely as ski pants, these things will exceed your needs and will never let you down. As rain pants, look elsewhere (something cheaper will do just as well). If you need a pair of bibs to operate as a go to ski/ mountaineering/ hiking/ workwear shell layer, these may be the best compromise I have found, although they are not quite as durable or waterproof as I wish.

Overall the fit on this jacket is nice but a bit on the baggy side for an arcteryx jacket,it's noticeably different from their other model as well as other jackets I've tried on in general.It fits more like a trench coat,this means it fits under the butt,has longer sleeves,and it has lots of room for layers while still feeling really mobile.It is definitely more of a performance long distance trekking/walking piece so if you're looking for a slim fit for running or climbing I would look elsewhere . I am 5""11 and 155 pounds with a long lanky build and I find the sleeves on this jacket almost too long in a size medium.To put it in perspective I don't fit mediums in pretty much any other company so keep that it mind if you want a slimmer/tighter fit,this jacket was designed for mobility and layering while hiking/walking,it will probably be too big for climbing or more high output activities.
