"Marmot","Tullus Down Jacket - Men's","2312342",4,"So I recently purchased 7 different down jackets so I could wear and compare and select the one I liked best. This was my great down jacket review, not because the review was great, but because the breadth of comparisons was pretty extensive. The ones I compared were the Marmot Zeus, Marmot Tullus, Mountain Hardware Nitrous, Mountain Hardwear Micro Ratio, Patagonia Down Sweater, The North Face Trevail, and the Outdoor Research Tanscendent. I'll put comments on the others in the listings for each. The reason I selected these are that they all are basically medium-weight down jackets (not extreme light or heavy) and were comparable on the prices. Backcountry was having a sale and all these were marked down to between $123 to $160.
What I wanted was a top layer jacket without a hood (don't use hoods very often). I generally don't use down jackets like these as a layer under anything because of their bulk. I prefer a synthetic for that. I have a huge down jacket with a hood for very cold weather. I wanted one that was less bulky and more suitable for activities.
So the Tullus. The Tullus was okay, but there were others that were better. The one I had was Skyline Blue and it's a nice looking color. The stitching on the jacket... something about the way the stitching goes down on the ends looked weird. 
Fit: The fit was good and normal. It wasn't so bulky that it restricted movement. The fit is regular and those who are used to athletic or trim fit may find it a bit larger than they are used to. But I thought it fit true to size. I have to get XL because of wide shoulders and long arms. The sleeves may not be long enough for guys more than a couple inches taller than me. The bottom of the jacket hit between the top of my pelvis and my hip joints. The fit looks good too. What I mean by that is that it doesn't look too square or too slouchy. I have a Marmot Quasar (ultra-light down) that is really square in the shoulders. As a result it looks kind of weird and pointy at the end of the shoulders. This one looks more natural.
Comfort: The jacket wasn't quite as comfortable as some but more than others. The fabric feels okay but doesn't feel as comfortable and quiet as some of the others I tried. The hand pockets are a bit more to the side than I would have liked and the openings could be a bit more angled. Neck and cuffs are basic but fine. 
I ended up returning the Tullus and choosing the Patagonia Down Sweater as it felt  a bit warmer, and lighter (800-fill down vs the Tullus' 600-fill down). However, this jacket is a fantastic value - it was $122. The Patagonia was $40 more. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-20 00:00:00","I returned this product before using it",""
"Marmot","Tullus Down Jacket - Men's","107793899",5,"This is a great jacket, here's why:
1.  Great value: I got it on sale for something like $125.  At that price it is a steal for the quality.
2.  Warm: not much to say about this.  It won't take you on an arctic expedition, but for the light weight, it is extremely warm.
3.  Quality: I believe Marmot is doing a great job with their products these days and this jacket is a great example thereof.  Only had it a couple months, but the initial quality impression is top notch.
4.  Weight: its light, but still warm.  Been my go to jacket this winter where temps have fallen to 0 degrees.  Its good on it's own down to about 30ish.  Below that, I include either a shell or another thermal layer.
5.  Fit: I'm about 6', 175 and the Medium fits me darn near perfect.  Nothing worse than short arms on a jacket.  No problem there as the arm length, I would say, is above average.
6.  Style: first day I wore it a friend said to me, ""Hey, where did you get that jacket?""  It looks great on!  I have the Steel Onyx color.

Highest recommendation.

PS - I first got the Marmot Zeus jacket that I returned because the outer fabric was too shiny for my tastes.  The finish on the Tullus jacket is quite matte looking.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-14 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Marmot","Tullus Down Jacket - Men's","107371815",5,"Me: 5'9"", 165 lbs., 32"" waist, long arms.

I bought this jacket for daily 1.5 mile walks in 35 to 55 degree, sometimes very windy weather in Minnesota.
I'm not kidding myself that this is a jacket that I can wear when the weather  gets too cold in Minnesota. 

I originally was looking at the Marmot Zeus jacket but that jacket appears to flare out a little toward the bottom and that kind of looks like coats that elderly ladies wear.

I bought the Tullus in Medium and it fits me GREAT.  The jacket is lightweight and doesn't restrict movement, and it keeps the wind out which is important to me because the route that I walk has zero protection from the wind in 3 directions.  I walk at a slightly fast pace and have not overheated in temps as high as 53 degrees, nor have I been cold in 32 degree, overcast, windy weather.

As I mentioned, this jacket fits great.  Marmot calls the fit of this jacket ""Athletic"" which means tighter at the shoulder and hem.  I am toned, but by no means skinny and there is still enough room in this jacket for me to wear a sweatshirt or even a thin hoodie underneath.  As I also mentioned, I have long arms; despite being 5""9"" tall, I am 6' from fingertip to fingertip, so I'm a knuckle-dragger, and I usually have problems with sleeves being too short when I wear Medium sizes.  The sleeves are perfect for me though and probably would fit well for people with regular arms also.  I can't say what the sleeves would fit like if you have alligator or T-rex arms though.

This jacket also looks great; I chose black and it is not too shiny or too dull either.  The collar can be worn down, up, or fully zipped up and each way is comfortable.  

Overall, I would recommend this jacket for the conditions that I mention above, especially if you want to look good while staying warm.  Props to Backcountry for the great price and getting it to me fast.

As usual, the genius behind Marmot's products easily go unnoticed by those who mistake them as just another Patagonia copycat brand - which they are not. For an athletic, regular, non-skinny male, Marmot is just a better fit. I'm an athletic 5'10"" 180 pound male and find all Marmot products fit like they were made for me.

This jacket is made to layer underneath, which is why everyone is in agreement about this jacket seeming one-size too big. It's like this because it's made to be this way - it's not a mistake. I wear my thin Marmot puffer jacket in the fall (55-35F)  and then when winter (< 35F) hits I throw the Astrum over my puffer and I'm good-to-go down to 0 degrees F. When I get hot because I'm being active/hiking/riding, I just take the Astrum off and put it back on when cool down or walking around town.

Bottomeline: This jacket is made to wear in cold temperatures (35-0F) with an optional under layer if you choose (think: fleece or thin puffer), while still allowing you room to be active. Marmot once again proves with the Astrum that it is a brand committed to making exceptional and minimalist clothing for active outdoorsmen (and women).

I was looking for an synthetic midweight jacket/hoody... and this is just that. Everyone makes one of these with small differences. Patagonia's Nano-Air, Arc's Atom and LT Atom Hoody... etc. etc. 

What I liked - I liked the roomier fit and the wider back. It has a non-technical feel to it. There is a small amount of stretch in all the material. Love the hand warmer pack pockets. 

What did not work for me - I found the Large a little too roomy, sleeves a touch long... but the medium too small. I found that I really wanted a vertical exterior chest pocket. 
The internal zippered pocket is on the left inside ... which bugs me... feels like is should be on the right. 

Very Nice piece but did not blow me away. I't trying others... trying not to buy a Arcyterx Atom Hoody... Why - because I know I love it but I have the jacket... and the Lt. Weight Jkt... and want some diversity... but maybe I don't?

"Marmot","Astrum Jacket - Men's","108429652",5,"I picked up this piece back in November for a solid and light winter mid-layer. The insulation, fit, weight, and color all really worked for me and what I needed. 

Use:
As of now I have put it through  5 months of alpine touring, resort skiing, winter camping,  climbing, and daily use here in chilly Salt Lake City.  Though I'd recommend layering this under a shell in any rainy/snowy conditions, I've done some seriously sweaty cardio, and been caught in some accidental blizzards with this jacket. The Thermal R Active insulation is very efficient in those less than ideal conditions, and I haven't had a single issue with warmth. Because of this insulation, the jacket doesn't need all the compartments to keep the insulation separated, therefore no ""cold spots"" between compartments. The inner material is very soft, and does not feel sticky when sweaty.

Fit:
The body of the jacket fits relatively ""Athletic"", though there is no restriction in range of motion, and room to layer. The hood fits very snug when cinched, and keeps you very warm. The arms fit a littler long and straight, meaning they scrunch up a bit on my skinny arms. This jacket would do really well for most body types, and especially people with longer arms. In general this jacket fits true to size, but if I had to pick small or large, I'd say it runs just a tad large. 

Overall:
I would most definitely recommend this to any and all outdoorsmen. This jacket has handled everything I've thrown at it, and I can tell will be a key piece in my collection for a long time. 
 
Cheers, 

Doug

"Marmot","Astrum Jacket - Men's","1301491132",5,"This thing's legit. I had been looking for an insulated jacket for a camping trip spanning Redwood National Park, Crater Lake, and Lassen Volcanic National Park this past week that was filled with various hikes and a few chilly night time camp fires/beer sessions. Honestly I can't say anything bad about it. 

It got put to the test during a hike up Lassen Peak. It was snowing and around 36°F at the base/beginning of the hike, and ended up being around 28°F with strong winds at 10,400'. The Astrum jacket and a single t-shirt underneath kept me comfortably warm the entire time and wasn't restricting at all. The only thing I wish I would've had were some gloves!

Side note, I live in Santa Cruz, CA, so those temps were really cold for me. I began the hike wearing a Marmot Minimalist jacket (size M) over top of the Astrum jacket, which actually turned out to be a pretty sweet (and waterproof) setup. I got warm wearing this combo during activity, but I was pretty happy I could layer both jackets.

While hanging around camp I wore it with a flannel shirt underneath and stayed comfortably warm.

I also find Marmot to be a bit longer than some of Patagonia's insulated offerings, which is appealing to me as well.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-09-24 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

Wore the Njord jacket with  t-shirt and jeans in 10 degree Fahrenheit weather to snow blow our driveway. Even with winds over 20 miles per hour my legs and body were perfect.  The coat extending down to knee length makes such a difference.  Aside from the incredible warmth the ergonomics are well done - pocket size & locations, great mobility in arms and shoulders (even when wearing a suit).  This may not be the coat I grab for formal occasions but it definitely looks sharp enough for business occasions.   I wear a 43/44 in sport coat an purchased the large.

"Marmot","Tungsten 4P Tent: 4-Person 3-Season","1693049",5,"Ordered this tent as a quick set up tent for road tripping and for canoe camping.

Ordered it and got it in no time at all thanks to Backcountry's free 2-day!!!!

Took it out of the box and set it up with no issues. Love is much that it comes with the foot print, never understood why so many tents make them a secondary item other then to make more money. I love the 2 smaller cross bars the hel lift the walls more vertical giving so much more room inside it. 

I am 6'2"" and had plenty of head and foot room. I also loved the fact that one side was like a huge mesh big screen tv while the regular tent fabric went farther up on the opposite side (this was very nice camping on Cougar Island, Ross Lake, Washington).

I was able to perfectly fit my 2 XXL cot pads in the tent creating a memory foam floor. Perfect road trip set up. 

Took the tent up on Ross Lake for 3 nights, a little boat/canoe camping. Never had to use the rain fly, but with Ross Lakes famous winds, I was able to point then mesh towards the lake for an HD view while lying in my bag and the fabric back was to the wind blocking it nicely.

There were 2 of us my size in there. With bags and pads, plus our gear, made it perfect for having plenty of space to organize and move around with out getting in each others way.  Would have have slept a 3rd comfortably... But would not run it as a true 4 person. . 

Tear down was simple as was packing it up. The tent bag gave plenty of room to roll and go. I have had some tents where it had to be folded a perfect way just to get it bag in the finicky tent bag, not with this one. 

Over all, this is going to be my new go to tent for canoe camping and as a back up tent for road tripping when not using my RTT. Great job Marmot!!!!

"Marmot","Tungsten 4P Tent: 4-Person 3-Season","110152826",5,"I have just gotten this tent and haven't slept in it yet, but do have some comments that would have helped me when I was making my decision.
1) the green color is very dull and in my opinion, depressing.  So sent it back for the orange.  The orange makes it brighter inside on a gray day - even though it's not my favorite color for tents in that it's too bright, it's better than the very dull green which definitely darkened the inside.
2) the chemical smell on first setting it up was not as strong as a Mountainsmith tent which I had to return immediately because it smelled like my new dolls used to smell and gave me a headache just setting it up.  This Marmot did have a ""gentle"" chemical smell (is there such a thing?) and I was concerned about it, so I set it up on a windy day in a day-use campsite where I hung out all afternoon till sunset.  The smell was gone by the time I packed it up.  This tent would not be for the active MCS (multiple chemical sensitivities) people, but as an almost fully recovered one, it will work....  mainly because I can't afford, for the amount I camp, a Moonlight tent.
3) The Tungsten 4 is the perfect size for my 6x3 fold out sleeping pad from Costco along with a 21"" suitcase opened out (I camp at festivals, for up to a week).   Other 4 person tents were just too big, even though they had a better height for standing up.   I am 5'2"" and can mostly stand up to put on pants; it was the compromise I chose since  I still have to bend over.
4) It is SO EASY to set up by myself, even as a short-ish person; very intuitive.  No hissy fit temper tantrums there!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-10-29 00:00:00","",""

"Marmot","Helium Sleeping Bag: 15 Degree Down","512443021",5," It's quickly becoming my tradition to backpack the high Sierras in late October with family and friends.  Last year I realized a few things about myself and sleeping bags while on the 6-day High Sierra Trail.  I don't like waking up cold!  I don't want to wear my puffy or extra layers to make a 30 degree bag work for 20+ degree nights.  And since I tend to huddle tightly in my bag when cold, my previous purchase of a semi-rectangular bag was a sacrifice of weight and warmth.  So I was on the hunt for a bag under two pounds in the 0-15 degree range.  I purchased the Marmot Helium after narrowing the field.  At 2.1 lbs. the value and quality of the Helium just can't be beat.  I was happy to catch the Backcountry Marmot sale and thanks to my Gearhead, Gabe, for rushing shipment in time for this year's trip to the Mineral King Wilderness.  At age 60 and a colder sleeper these days, the Helium made all the difference in a great night's sleep above the tree line in mid-20s.  The 800 fill compressed well to eliminate bulk in my HMG 2400.  I wear a L shirt (42-44"" chest) and had enough room for movement as a side sleeper.  The materials are soft, warm, quiet, light, and kept the bag on the sleeping pad.  And I stayed completely cozy in a base layer.  I was surprised at how light and airy it felt, and for the first time found myself comfortably breathing fine while completely submerged with my head covered.  Great 3-season pick!

I'm 6'5"" tall and fit in the Long with room to spare for extra socks and the morning's clothes at my feet. The good cinched down perfectly so my mouth and nose were left exposed, so condensation from breathing didn't foul the bag. The nice long zip made temp control a simple task, as my first multi day  use was in Iceland with temps ranging from 35-65 F.  It is water resistant, and even when the shell is waterlogged, the down didn't compress too badly. 

It packs down to the size of a large grapefruit, I used a small S2S eVent compression sack. As far as weight, it was barely noticeable as I was not pushing for ultralight - at just over 2 pounds, it easily fits into a very light pack. 

All in all, it's a terrific bag and I will update my review after winter when I can push it past its ratings. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-10-13 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

The Tungsten was extremely easy to setup, took me less than 5 minutes, I didn't add the guy-lines to the tent due to the beautiful weather we had, just put it up with the included footprint, staked it down with the included stakes and installed the rain cover.
 The original plan was to let the 3 boys sleep in the Marmot Tungsten, and I would sleep in a Marmot Eclipse 2 person. That did not end up the way I planned at all. All 3 boys, my niece, nephew and grandson begged for scary stories when we lit the campfire after dark. So the sleeping arrangements changed really fast.

"Marmot","Tungsten 3p Tent: 3-Person 3-Season","107670292",4,"... but it appears that backcountry no longer carries it.

INITIAL THOUGHTS
The problem with tents is that the sharply loping sides rob you of head and footroom.  A 7' tent is 7' floor but after putting a couple inches of airpad in, your head is inches higher than the floor so that 7' turns into 5'6"" sleeping room.
Thus I liked the straight sides of the Marmot and wanted the Limelight-2 as that is comfortable for a single person and ok for two.  For some reason I got the Tungsten over the Limelight (probably that $50) as the sizes are comparable.  The Limelight is an inch higher and has an extra square-foot of floorspace which comes down to maybe 3' extra footroom in the Limelight.  For a Kayaker, the extra 5 ounces of the Limelight are irrelevant and both tents pack the same.  The Limelight has bigger doors which is a plus but....
I bought the tent from Backcountry and it arrived a few days later!  WOW!!!

I set it in the living room and the tent set up easily.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  one side of the tent has a small orange tab on the tent-pole flaps.  Those are the loops into which you put the tips of your poles.  The rainfly has, on one side tiny orange flaps.  Match these so orange fly matches orange tent.  I asked the woman at REI why and she did not know but if you mismatch them, the door in the fly will NOT match the door in the tent.  So match these orange tabs and the doors will open the same way.

I liked how there was nylon over the head area but the rest of the tent was net.  This allows for some star-gazing in good weather with just enough privacy or shade over your head.
I liked that crossbar as it opens headroom and that is more comfortable.

Packing:  I am a kayaker so space is more valuable that is weight.  I can slide the poles and hammer between my seat and kayak, the stakes in my deck-bag and squish the tent between bulkhead and foot-pegs so it packs well in my kayak.  I like the idea of beaching and having my tent handy as the first thing I unpack and set-up.  THEN I unload the rest of my gear and the Tungsten fits in my cockpit easily and safely as the footpegs hold it in place against the bulkhead.  Other paddlers shove their tent far into the bow and the fly/footprint far into the stern to balance the boat, but these people have to totally unload their kayak to get to the tent.  My way gives me a place to store my gear as I unload which is a plus if it is raining when you beach.

MINUS:  the footprint is too small.  It is also difficult to mount on the tent pole unless you put the footprint on first which I dislike doing.
I like a floor in my vestibule so I ruined the return  on the tent by modifying the footprint.  I had another footprint from an old ruined tent so I sewed that to the main-vestibule side of the footprint, set the tent and fly up and traced the vestibule.  Then I cut and hemmed the new flap, added a stake-loop and used the remainder of the old footprint for the back vestibule.
Some people ask ""why"" but it keeps my gear cleaner and keeps the inside of the tent cleaner as I leave my dirt on the modified footprint and not in the tent. 
There is supposed to be an attic with the tent but I never found mine.  I only use the attic for a light and with the light-diffuser flap over the head, I will not miss the attic.  It gets in the way when I kneel anyway.

PLUS: The high sides that add to floor space!!!  I can go almost to the edge of the floor and still NOT have my head poking into the fabric!   More than anything else, this is why people buy the Marmot!

I gave this 4 stars because I only tested it in the living room.  Next week I will take it on a week-long kayak trip down the Colorado River and will give a better review when I return.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-10-30 00:00:00","",""

This one's no different. I like lots of space for myself and my gear, and this beauty did indeed give me that. I just took it to the Oregon coast for two-weeks. The only time it wasn't 100% awesome was during a 9-hour rain storm where a bit of rain got inside from hitting the ground and bouncing up under the fly and hitting the mesh wall on that side. The issue is that the fly only goes down so far (about eight inches or so from the ground), therefore if the rain is pounding endlessly at the right angle it's only a matter of time. Other than that one night, and we did get plenty of various rain at other times, it was pretty much the perfect 3-season tent... light, roomy, great ventilation, two large doors and nicely sized vestibules. I don't think I'm a fan of the two cross poles connected via the clip at the top of the tent. I'd personally prefer the two main poles be separate as the setup was a bit trickier trying to get the pole tips on the other end into their respective grommets while setting it up on my own. Not a deal breaker, just a preference. The set up was still pretty quick and easy.

The selling point of the tent is the steep sidewalls, which allow use of the area where the wall hits the floor.  This works - the tent is roomier than tents with similar footprints.  Headroom is comfortable and setup is straightforward.  There are a few perks, such as a ceiling headlamp pocket, two doors, and doohickeys to keep the vents open.   A few caveats: The tent's profile will create wind resistance, so bring extra pegs and guy line.  The fly could come closer to the ground and the vestibules are small.

At nights, the winds blew so hard, it woke us up. Winds pushed so hard against the tent, but it never once uprooted. The poles would push inward, but they never once bent permanently out of place. Marmot thought of everything when they made this tent. We pitched it in about 5 minutes. Everything latches on, there's no pushing poles through holes. Even the poles themselves are one single piece when put together. And for a two person tent, it was incredibly roomy, even with a 6'3"" guy with me. The side vestibules are handy for gear, but we kept everything in the car because of the high winds. It comes with a footprint that matches the size of the tent exactly, but it would be nice to have something that extended out a little to offer coverage under the vestibules for shoes and gear. Easy addition though. All in all, I highly recommend this tent. The quality is out of this world, and for the price, I truly believe it's the best bang for your buck on the market.

Although it's a bit on the large side for  backpacking, I can attest to the Limelight's dependability after getting caught in a snowstorm at nearly 12,000 ft elevation. 

The fly is separated from the mesh by a few inches once fully set up, and this seemingly small feature made a world of difference when it was 20-ish degrees out. My spouse, our 70 lb dog, and I were stuck in our Limelight for around 15 hours due to a nasty late-spring snowstorm, and this thing kept out all moisture and provided the three of us ample room. Even after many hours of condensation buildup on the fly from breathing heavily (not to mentioned outside snow piling up), we stayed warm and dry. The spacing between the fly and mesh kept the frozen barrier outside of human contact, and all of us safe and warm.

I have camped in two different snowstorms, one night of rain, and bright moonlight (so far) and have had zero issues. It's even easy to set up on your own and having two vestibules is a MUST when you want quick access to gear. Plus a perfectly-sized footprint is included?!

"Marmot","Limelight 2P Tent: 2-Person 3-Season","109273630",4,"So why this tent over another tent? I think Marmot was really aimed at livability when they redesigned the Limelight. The bent poles really do add a lot more space inside the tent, and this is truly a two person tent with plenty of space for you a friend. However, the pre-bent poles make packing the poles an awkward experience, rather than if they were all straight. This adds extra room to its pack size, and makes putting them inside you pack a challenge at times. I found it easier to leave the poles on the outside of your pack for this reason. Ventilation is decent, and I think having the tent fully staked out helps reduce condensation drastically. The ventilation flaps aren't very large, but better than none. It has also kept me dry in very wet conditions, but in cooler weather (40F at night) I was wanting there to be zippered flaps on the mesh part of the doors that could be closed up. This is where a good sleeping bag comes into play, and not my 8 year old summer bag. However, I do enjoy having very high walls on all four sides, and leaving the only mesh portions to be on the upper half of the tent body. I've had it in windy conditions (30mph gusts) and with just the 8 critical points staked out I noticed that the rainfly became convex in shape on the two shorter ends due to the boxy base created by the pre bent pole design, which brought the rainfly much closer to the tent body. This ultimately leads to less airflow throughout the tent. I tried staking out the additional guy lines and this only helped the problem on a small scale. I tried to stake the two side guy points on the shorter ends farther away from the tent body, but this also saw minimal improvement. I'm not sure how this will play into the tent's overall weather performance in truly tougher conditions, but it should be okay. One thing I was not expecting, or somewhat forgot to take into serious account when I purchased this tent was the actual color of the tent. If you look closely the  lower portion of the rainfly is actually a much darker, almost red-orange color. I actually like that color a lot, however I am not so much of a fan of how bright orange the rest of the fly is. Don't get me wrong I think the color orange is great, but man this orange is bright. In the middle of spring/summer when everything around you is greener than a leprechaun this thing stands out. Bad. Maybe I'm being over dramatic about it, but I wish they would have offered this tent in the green color they had for the last model.
Overall, the livability of this tent is fantastic. Two huge doors, two large vestibules, sturdy construction/design. Great for car camping, but don't be afraid to take it out on the trail with you because it really isn't that heavy. This thing exudes quality.

One of the side vent panels in mine had a seam that had been folded over and the stitching  was only holding the mesh vent panel to the tent body. I didn't see this within Backcountry's return period so I had to go through Marmot's warranty program. Good news is that it was easy to set up, they paid shipping both ways, and their warranty site shows you the work they are doing. I had it back in my hands less than three weeks after I dropped it off at FedEx. The initial setup was slow via email (a few days in between) but I chose that method so I could include pictures from the get go.

As for the tent, I've had no problems at all. This is being used as a comfy tent and won't see much abuse. Plenty of room for a queen size air mattress (which fits through the door inflated), moto gear bags, and everything the dog wants to bring along. The tent poles don't seem flimsy at all but I can see them bending if they are handled from the very end (think what happens when you extend a tape measure too far).  This thing is almost 7ft tall in the center and has a 10x10ft footprint, the poles are extremely long. I use the 'halo' pole to tie off a clothesline to and there was no concern for stability.

"Marmot","Halo 6-Person Tent: 6-Person 3-Season","1233611541",4,"I really hope I can update this review later on and add more stars but as of right now, I have a really sour taste in my mouth which is such a bummer!!
We have two big dogs (husky and wirehaired pointer) and a toddler along with my husband and I, so we purchased this tent so we would have plenty of room to sleep comfortably, and fit a pack n' play if needed. It is excellent for that! Tons of room, and great head room! 
Here is the bummer part... I have literally only set up this tent twice, and had to cut our camping trip short... 
The first time I set it up, I was in our backyard just to see how big it was and how to set it up and get familiar with it.. and a pole bent! It made the tent lean to one side, so that was a total bummer and showed me how not durable the poles are if you only set it up once and that happens. 
I figured it would still be okay, so we took it up camping the following weekend, and set it up there, and one more of the smaller poles (halo part) bent as well!! AND we go two rips in the tent too. One of the clips to attach the poles to the tent just ripped right off... total bummer! We just packed up and left we were so bugged by it. 
So I hit up Marmot about this, and they hooked it up, I sent back the tent to them, and they repaired it in about two-three weeks time for me. I just got it back the other day, and we are planning to take it out camping this weekend. So I really hope I can provide an update with  better stars and a more raving review about this tent. I SO wanted to love it, but right now I am torn, just like my tent. 


*** Follow Up- added a star!***

Like the title of this review, Marmot has one of the best warranty departments I have ever had to work with! I really really love their company for that reason! It was super easy to submit a warranty issue and send the product to them, the repaired it in a couple weeks, and sent it back to me all fixed up! 
I am very impressed with the quality of their repairs, it is as if the rips didn't happen, and the tent is like new again which is awesome! 
We took out the tent on a family camping trip, and it was a lot of fun! The tent is super spacious and fits us all really well with some room to spare. I love that I can stand up in the tent and walk around comfortably! 

It was pretty windy when we went camping once, and it doesn't hold up well in wind, which I kind of expected since it is a taller tent, and will just grab that wind easily. But other than that, we really have enjoyed this tent now that it is repaired! 

Thank you Marmot!! <3","EMPLOYEE","2016-08-02 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions","true"

I was hesitant to spend the money, but after researching many 6-person tents, my husband and I decided on the Halo 6 for several reasons. First was quality, and boy has this tent delivered. The full rain fly has been put to the test and I'm happy to report that we stayed completely dry. The poles are extremely sturdy and the tent and fly material is rugged. This tent is so easy to set-up, I've done it by myself several times. Second, we needed a tent with some height as my husband is 6'. He can comfortably stand in the tent with a lamp hanging in the middle with plenty of room to spare. Finally, we needed floor space. It's just the 2 of us, but we have 2 full size dogs. A queen air mattress and the dogs bedding all fits with room to spare for our gear. 2 fairly good sized vestibules helps out a lot as well.
The poles that hold the rain fly off the tent do a good job at letting fresh air circulate in. I hope to never have to use the lifetime manufacturers warranty, however it's nice knowing it's there if needed. This is by far the best tent we've owned!

It's gigantic!  Almost embarrassingly so, but it was great for long periods away from home since I could comfortably fit all my gear plus a table and chair and have a refuge to hang out in during inclement weather.  And while the description says a 6' person can stand in it, that's an understatement, because my 6'5"" husband can stand in it with plenty of headroom.  We've been using it both as a base station for work trips to some property we own in Northwestern Montana, and also as a backyard 'guest room' for overflow sleeping space in the summer.  It's so large and comfy that guests actually enjoy it.  It's also sturdy in a storm, and very stable even in high winds.  Have stayed it in a couple of downpours with wind-driven rain and stayed perfectly dry.  My only complaint is the webbing on two of the corners where the stakes poke through the grommet is starting to show some wear around the edges of the grommet.  I think the grommet is a long way from pulling out of the webbing, but even if it does, I'm not really worried as Marmot is typically great about standing behind their products.  Also, a person buying it should be aware that this tent is 10'x10' with two 4' vestibules, and it may not handily fit in some regular tent sites in National and State park campgrounds.

We purchased this tent for a mixture of car camping and backpacking for 2 people and a dog and it is just the right size! Plenty of room for the extra gear while car camping yet light weight enough to pack it 10 miles into the backcountry!

The bent pole design is great to give you that extra room at sitting level and not have to worry about sharp angled walls chewing up your space.

Living in San Diego we rarely see rain, but on our 6th weekend out in this tent  we got some heavy rain and were drenched.  Fly leaked and the bottom of the tent soaked through to our sleeping pads. Everything was staked out tight and proper. The tent was not stored in extreme conditions and was practically brand new. So disappointing.

That said I love this tent so much (lightweight, easy to set up, HUGE for a 2 person tent) we talked about buying expensive waterproofer, etc. to make it work. But that just doesn't make sense.

Since I'm not getting any younger I wanted something lighter than the 11 pounds of pack weight but didn't want to give up all the space.  After reading the reviews we decided to make the purchase.  We have since used it about 100 miles of backpacking trips so I feel as though I can give an accurate review.  Build quality is very good, and interior space is accurate.  I am 6 foot and have plenty of room.  Its my 11 year old daughter and wife who share these accommodations and we all fit with room to spare.  The only real issues I have is the rain fly, it does not go all the way to the ground so in the rain you get quite a bit of water splatter on the tent walls.  And if you plan on sleeping with the ridge vents closed it does not vent well.  Mornings always consisted with us pulling the fly and laying out in the sun to dry even on nights with no rain.  Overall weight is ok and packs with footprint under 7 pounds.  Still heavy for a backpack tent but doable and way better than my old Eureka.  Goes up in like 2 minutes and the pole system is very easy, it also holds its shape well in heavy winds.  Overall if you are doing weekend trips this is a good choice, but if you are planning an extended hike those extra pounds have a way of sneaking up on you!  Good buy.

I took this thing out for its first run to the Moab desert, and we tested it to its limits. We pitched this little tent on top of a cliff overlooking the Green River. At nights, the winds blew so hard, it woke us up. Winds pushed so hard against the tent, but it never once uprooted. The poles would push inward, but they never once bent permanently out of place. Marmot thought of everything when they made this tent. We pitched it in about 5 minutes. Everything latches on, there's no pushing poles through holes. Even the poles themselves are one single piece when put together. And for a three person tent, it was incredibly roomy, even with a 6'3"" guy with me and another girl. The side vestibules are handy for gear, but we kept everything in the car because of the high winds. It comes with a footprint that matches the size of the tent exactly, but it would be nice to have something that extended out a little to offer coverage under the vestibules for shoes and gear. Easy addition though. All in all, I highly recommend this tent. The quality is out of this world, and for the price, I truly believe it's the best bang for your buck on the market.

The second night of camping we were gifted with a tremendous thunder and lightning storm. Everyone else got wet that night, except for my gf and I. Tucked away safely in our limelight it held up to strong winds and torrential rain for several hours. Marmot has made a wonderful product and I highly recommend checking this tent out.

There are some great youtube video reviews of the tent, but I wanted to add a few things that are not clear on the tent specs and not in the reviews I have seen so far.

The tent shows that the fly can be setup as a canopy, but the poles are not included with the kit. I bought a set of MSR poles separately.

The tent comes with six lines that are black. Six is enough lines depending on how you want to tie the flies, you may want to pick up more. I do not like the black because of visibility at night. I replaced the lines with a set from MSR that were reflective.

The tent can use up to 18 stakes, 20 stakes possibly depending on how you setup the flies. The tent only comes with 14 stakes that are the hook style. The stakes are durable, but the design does not do well in soft or sandy soil. I replaced the stakes with MSR groundhogs.

The lack of poles, the black lines, and the lack of stakes as well as the style is why I gave a 4 star review. The tent itself is wonderful, Marmot just needs to improve the accessories included.

I took a tape and measured the floor. My numbers may not be exact, but should be close. The main area is 100”x118”, 100” being from door to door. The vestibule is 99” at the mouth and tapers to 50” at the wall. From the wall of the vestibule to the main area is 67”.

I recommend buying the footprint that is sold separately by Marmot. Also, be sure to store the tent in a climate controlled area when not in use to keep the laminate from melting and ruining waterproofing of the tent.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-05-24 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

Features that I liked best during our 4 day stay were: #1 Vents-I think these really help to keep interior condensation to a minimum. In the mornings everything else in camp had thick dew, inside was dry. (overnight temps. in 30's) #2 Roll up flap at front entry of rain fly-Made the hundreds of entry/exits easy with 3 guys constantly sorting gear. #3 Nice mesh door panels-Kept the insects out and let fresh air circulate. #4 Easy set up & take down-Honestly 1 person can set this up & take down in less than 10mins. unless you are a complete moron.

I have been through some nasty storms that have blown over trees and the limestone 3P was completely dry the entire time. This tent however, I set up in 10 to 20 mph winds, which was very difficult because of its size when you are setting it up by yourself. Once I got it up, I made the mistake of putting the rain fly on because we were supposed to get rain later that night. Needless to say once a gust of wind came up it bent my 2 main poles. So I took it down and moved to a different campsite that is out of the wind. Then I set it back up and realized that the poles were ruined. I was very upset at this point. I bent the poles back so I could at least stay in the tent that night. I feel that this error was more a little bit of my fault but I think those poles were bad. So I emailed marmot that night and I continue camping for the weekend. I get back home and wait a few days and have no response from marmot. So I called them. However says there customer service or warranty is bad is wrong. I called them. I got a lady on the phone and she couldn't believe my story. Then she sent me a tracking number to my email. She said that when I drop the poles off at fedex to ship, to email her back and let her know. So I emailed her back right when I sent them and she overnighted me all brand new poles at no  charge to me. I have been out in wind since then and the tent was fine. I did stake out the rain fly and I think that helps out a lot in the wind. The pockets are nice and big. I will say that you can watch all the videos you want, you can't grasp how large this is until you are in it. I purchased this for car camping with my family. If it wasn't for the pole incident it would get 5 stars but marmot took care of me on that.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-05-12 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

In the past I have owned a lot of ""slim fit"" style of pants because I don't like overly baggy pants. The Freerider pant wasn't necessarily slim but they definitely weren't baggy and I  really like the overall fit.  As an aggressive skier it was imperative for me to get a pant that wouldn't get torn up by my ski edges and so far these have held up very well, a few scuffs of course but no rips.  The Goretex has kept me dry and I've stayed warm using a variety of different baselayer's depending on the temperatures, I am always able to easily dump heat with the the side zips if needed. One of the biggest reasons I decided to go with the Freerider pant over other similar pants, was all of the pockets. I love the placement and design of the cargo/thigh pockets. From pocketing random items when I leave the house in the morning to carrying extra neck gaiter, cliff bar, chapstick and glove liners, the pockets have been very useful to me! If the Marmot La Meije pant was available in my size I probaby would've have gone with that, just because of the removable bib, but the La Meije pant had one less pocket. I imagine that these pants will last me a long time but I will definitely be looking to Marmot when I get my next pair of ski pants.

I have already managed to put a couple of small cuts down by the reinforced ankle area but hasn't cut right through.

This bag performed well with two notable complaints:  I found the stitching in the quilting of the bag to be limiting.  It feels as the stitching restricts movement rather than stretching with the user as the stitching in the lithium does.  The material also loses down more quickly than I have experienced with my Lithium.  A friend of mine using the women's Ouray sleeping bag (2017) has experienced a similar rate of loss of down. Overall, I would absolutely buy this bag again with the expectation of a limited season 30-45 degrees (Autumn). For colder sleepers, I recommend the Marmot Lithium.","EMPLOYEE","2017-08-30 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer","true"

With a silk bag liner and decent sleeping pads I bet you could even get into the lower temps comfortably.   

Putting two bags together to make one larger bag has also worked really well.  The heat seems to stay inside even though there is extra room at the top of the bag due to combining two mummy style bags.

The internal stash pocket for keeping those items that tend to loose battery life in the cold has been an excellent feature.  The hydrophobic down insulation has also worked well keeping the bag dry and warm when condensation collects in the tent.

The only real disadvantage I've experienced would be the loft of the bag.  It feels like it should be a little loftier, even for a 650 fill.

Even when it's bitter cold, I don't need a hat because the hood is so warm, I don't need gloves as the pockets have a very warm fleece lining and I don't need a scarf because the coat zips up to just below my nose and has a nice fleece lining around the neck.  I find the sizing perfect - it fits great with just a long sleeve tee under it or with a bulky sweater. And lots of pockets for all my stuff!  Try it, you won't regret it!!

"Marmot","Montreaux Down Coat - Women's","108672083",2,"The fit issues many reviewers mention unfortunately apply to me. The medium was snug and felt uncomfortable and restricted. I could get away with wearing a long sleeve t-shirt under it, but anything more substantial made it visibly tight to others. The sleeves were a bit too short. The length was fantastic though, coming to about mid-knee, but still easy to walk in.

The large was uncomfortably large and baggy. I could fit two of my arms in one of the coat's arms. The length increased to below my knees. The sleeves were much too long for me, coming down to cover my hands to the base on my fingers. 

However, if you find the right fit, I don't think you can get a better winter coat. Marmot thought of everything with this one (other than size, I guess). The fleece lining in the pockets, torso, and collar is fantastic. It's puffy, but still sleek. The pockets are deep and the inside pockets are great additions. The collar is high, but not too high, and cozy. The hood is very warm and can be tightened. The best part is that it's warm enough to make me comfortable outside on a below zero Fahrenheit day without any extra layers.

The zipper did stick on both. The hood is too deep to wear comfortably with the fur on a regular basis since it sticks out from my face by a few inches. It would be excellent if there were a cinch cord to adjust the hood depth like my TNF rain jacket has.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-10 00:00:00","",""

"Marmot","Montreaux Down Coat - Women's","108954200",5,"I am absolutely thrilled that I decided to go with this coat. I did a lot of research before deciding, and was willing to spend much more. This coat is the warmest I've ever had - in the past I've only had Northface. The coat arrived just in time for us to begin 20-30 below temps and I was so impressed (shocked in fact) that it fit the bill. The fit is great, I am typically a small but went with the medium after reading some of the other feedback. The coat has an hourglass shape to it which looks a bit more feminine compared to a straight up and down. The sew pattern is also attractive. My only minor complaint is that the sleeves are a bit short on my longer arms. It hits right at the wrist so without a longer glove I would have exposure. My ideal solve for that would be to bring the fabric down to the hand so that you could insert your thumb. The inside of the coat to the waste is fleece -love this. If I wear a lighter layer underneath this has eliminated the cold feeling of the material against the body. I love that the coat actually goes to my knees, I am about 5'8 and my NF, despite the claim of being knee length, hit me at least 2 inches above the knee. In very cold temps, especially with wind, the tops of my knees were always pretty cold. The hood on the jacket actually covers my face and ears without falling down! It was impossible for me to keep the hood on my NF up, and even if it were possible after my ears it didn't cover a thing. If I have this fully zipped with the hood up the only thing not covered are my eyes and my nose. This makes a huge different in below zero temps, especially with a brutal wind. The 700 fill makes a huge difference as compared to my NF 550 fill. Honestly this coat has exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. My aunt has a CG and I tried it on, I actually do prefer the fit and fill of of the Marmot. The biggest difference I would say is the waterproofing of the CG but with that addition you do sacrifice a bit of comfort. After using Northface coats for so many years I think I grew a bit complacent in that I figured for the price I wasn't going to do much better - clearly I should've branched out. I would absolutely recommend this coat to anyone living in extreme cold, and if you are within the 20 - 15 degree winters I'd say you'll never be cold again!

"Marmot","Montreaux Down Coat - Women's","100370658",5,"I was on the hunt for a heavy winter coat, and all reviews pointed to this baby as the best combo of warmth & reasonable cost.  I ordered two Marmot coats - the Montreaux and the Chelsea (because the Chelsea had better water resistance ratings) both in Port Royal, both in Medium.  They both fit just fine, but the Montreaux was the clear winner for me.  It is lighter weight, softer fabric so it moves with you better, and the fleece lining is heaven!  I was worried about the color being too orange and shiny, but I love it in person.  It's a dark burgundy with a slight blue undertone and no shine - I think it's a great neutral and a refreshing break from the sea of black coats I see out & about here in New England.

Sizing: I found it to be a true medium, with none of the tightness in the chest others have mentioned, even with a bulky sweater underneath.  I like the length; it hits right at my knees, not too long or too short. The sleeves are just long enough for me, but I do have longer than usual arms.  The important thing is I have no gapping or wind leaks when wearing gloves, so long enough when it counts!

Additional Positives: Warm warm warm! Wore this shoveling the plowed-in driveway, and was sweating buckets within minutes! The fleece lining, as mentioned before, is amazing.  21 degrees & windy this morning walking the dog, and with the hood up I didn't need a hat or scarf!  I will never again buy a coat that doesn't have fleece or some such lining the neck; ditto for fleece-lined pockets positioned behind the down layer (check & check).  The quality of the faux fur on the hood was a pleasant surprise - very soft and pretty.  Love the 4 pockets!  I'm able to run to the store without a purse (huge plus in my book), with enough space for my keys, wallet, glasses and phone, all safe from scratching each other, and still have room left over for my hands :-)

Negatives: While I love the abundance of pockets, the 2 outer ones hang strangely low.  Not an uncomfortable level for hands, but I find walking annoying and sitting impossible with anything solid, like my phone, in an outside pocket (it's just an iPhone 6s, not the bigger plus) because it hits right at the hip joint, something I've never experienced before.  I'll get used to putting my phone in an inner pocket, but that's less convenient, especially since I have to unzip the coat to access those pockets and that lets the cold in.  Brrr!  Really wish this had a placket with snaps like the Chelsea, for those times when I don't want to fully zip up such as quickly dashing from the house to the car, or running to check the mail.  Lastly, a back drawstring on the hood would have been nice.  When up it does come pretty far forward, blocking peripheral vision.  However, I will say that I didn't mind this aspect at all when it was windy!

My specs: I'm 5'6"", 145 lbs, sizes 4/6 and 36a/34c depending on the manufacturer (seriously people, can't we get some uniformity on sizing?!), something of an hourglass frame.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-19 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

The L was too tight in the chest (which seriously NEVER happens to me) and the XL fit well in the chest but was ridiculously loose everywhere else.

After my first summer with these gloves, winter rolled around as it always does... I found myself out a pair of ski gloves and grabbed these in the early season as a substitute. I didn't plan on using them long; just until I snagged something heavier and more activity-suited... I used these the entire season. Amazingly, even on CO's coldest days my hands were never cold. Maybe I have unnaturally good hand circulation, or maybe these gloves just rock. Anyway, even after countless uses throughout the previous summer and countless days on the slopes, the gloves were still ready for many more adventures.

I still have that original pair, but purchased a fresh pair in the Spring in preparation for a season working with the Forest Service. I've put my newest pair through a lot. They may be permanently stained with tree sap and bar oil, but they're holding up just as well as ever.

"Marmot","Gravity Softshell Jacket - Men's","106688797",4,"Bought this to replace a TNF fleece that had served as my casual work jacket for about 4 years. Wanted something a little sleeker that wouldn't grab fuzz like fleece. Looked at all the usual players and decided on the Marmot Gravity and overall it's a great jacket. 

The construction is absolutely solid. Fabric has a great feel and look to it, and it's very functional in terms of pockets and layout. It seems warm for what it is, but I'm in TX and have yet to wear it in a true cold environment. I also like/appreciate that the logos are subtle, not so in-your-face as some other brands. I'm paying for your product, not for the chance to advertise for you.

I'm 5'9"", 175"" with a fairly athletic build. I 32"" waist, 42"" coat and normally wear either a large (athletic cut) or medium (regular cut) shirt. I ordered this jacket in Large and I think it's about right. It's not a tight fit, by any means, and the arms are about 3"" too long, but when zipped up it's actually a very tailored fit in the chest/armpits, so I seriously doubt that a Medium would have worked. I don't mind the arms being a little long because with the velcro cuff adjustments it's fine, and with the added length the sleeves don't ride up when reaching/climbing/etc. 

I would rate this jacket a solid 4.5 stars. My only wish is that the fit was a little more trim in the large, but I'm perpetually in size hell (medium too small, large too big) so I don't really fault Marmot on this one. Highly recommend.

Was looking for a comparable jacket that was preferably not North Face since absolutely everyone at my college has them. I always liked the looks of Marmot jackets so decided to try this Gravity, got the light/dark gray color. I'm 5'11"" & 160 & went with a large size since I don't like my jackets too tight & having the options to layer under it. I think it's fit is almost perfect, sleeves a tad long but my only complaint. Looks extremely sleek & understated. Love the way it looks & fits. 

Jacket is pretty warm for a non insulated softshell. Warmer then my Apex Bionic but that may be due to the fact that it's a little tighter fit & the sleeve style is not as baggy as the bionic & sleeve length is a little on the long side protecting my arms/hands, esp in driving winds. Performs great in winds, even cold very strong winds & Marmot has the best DWR I've ever seen if you experience brief downpours. I am completely satisfied going with the Marmot Gravity as my everyday light jacket. In the few weeks I've had it, it stands up to all kinds of weather conditions in Denver (Colorado has huge fluctuations in weather day to day). Initial impressions of build quality is fantastic. My only regret is they no longer sell the Super Gravity (hooded version) of this jacket. It does have a chest pocket like the Bionic but it is internal & has a sleeve pocket at well. 

If your in the market for a non insulated softshell I'd suggest giving this jacket a chance. Great build quality, beautiful styling & warm/very wind resistant for its class. I love my Gravity, wish I would of bought one sooner.

"Marmot","Montreaux Down Coat - Women's","108672083",2,"The fit issues many reviewers mention unfortunately apply to me. The medium was snug and felt uncomfortable and restricted. I could get away with wearing a long sleeve t-shirt under it, but anything more substantial made it visibly tight to others. The sleeves were a bit too short. The length was fantastic though, coming to about mid-knee, but still easy to walk in.

The large was uncomfortably large and baggy. I could fit two of my arms in one of the coat's arms. The length increased to below my knees. The sleeves were much too long for me, coming down to cover my hands to the base on my fingers. 

However, if you find the right fit, I don't think you can get a better winter coat. Marmot thought of everything with this one (other than size, I guess). The fleece lining in the pockets, torso, and collar is fantastic. It's puffy, but still sleek. The pockets are deep and the inside pockets are great additions. The collar is high, but not too high, and cozy. The hood is very warm and can be tightened. The best part is that it's warm enough to make me comfortable outside on a below zero Fahrenheit day without any extra layers.

The zipper did stick on both. The hood is too deep to wear comfortably with the fur on a regular basis since it sticks out from my face by a few inches.

"Marmot","Montreaux Down Coat - Women's","108954200",5,"I am absolutely thrilled that I decided to go with this coat. I did a lot of research before deciding, and was willing to spend much more. This coat is the warmest I've ever had - in the past I've only had Northface. The coat arrived just in time for us to begin 20-30 below temps and I was so impressed (shocked in fact) that it fit the bill. The fit is great, I am typically a small but went with the medium after reading some of the other feedback. The coat has an hourglass shape to it which looks a bit more feminine compared to a straight up and down. The sew pattern is also attractive. My only minor complaint is that the sleeves are a bit short on my longer arms. It hits right at the wrist so without a longer glove I would have exposure. My ideal solve for that would be to bring the fabric down to the hand so that you could insert your thumb. The inside of the coat to the waste is fleece -love this. If I wear a lighter layer underneath this has eliminated the cold feeling of the material against the body. I love that the coat actually goes to my knees, I am about 5'8 and my NF, despite the claim of being knee length, hit me at least 2 inches above the knee. In very cold temps, especially with wind, the tops of my knees were always pretty cold. The hood on the jacket actually covers my face and ears without falling down! It was impossible for me to keep the hood on my NF up, and even if it were possible after my ears it didn't cover a thing. If I have this fully zipped with the hood up the only thing not covered are my eyes and my nose. This makes a huge different in below zero temps, especially with a brutal wind. The 700 fill makes a huge difference as compared to my NF 550 fill. Honestly this coat has exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. My aunt has a CG and I tried it on, I actually do prefer the fit and fill of of the Marmot. The biggest difference I would say is the waterproofing of the CG but with that addition you do sacrifice a bit of comfort. After using Northface coats for so many years I think I grew a bit complacent in that I figured for the price I wasn't going to do much better - clearly I should've branched out. I would absolutely recommend this coat to anyone living in extreme cold, and if you are within the 20 - 15 degree winters I'd say you'll never be cold again!

"Marmot","Montreaux Down Coat - Women's","100370658",5,"I was on the hunt for a heavy winter coat, and all reviews pointed to this baby as the best combo of warmth & reasonable cost.  I ordered two Marmot coats - the Montreaux and the Chelsea (because the Chelsea had better water resistance ratings) both in Port Royal, both in Medium.  They both fit just fine, but the Montreaux was the clear winner for me.  It is lighter weight, softer fabric so it moves with you better, and the fleece lining is heaven!  I was worried about the color being too orange and shiny, but I love it in person.  It's a dark burgundy with a slight blue undertone and no shine - I think it's a great neutral and a refreshing break from the sea of black coats I see out & about here in New England.

Sizing: I found it to be a true medium, with none of the tightness in the chest others have mentioned, even with a bulky sweater underneath.  I like the length; it hits right at my knees, not too long or too short. The sleeves are just long enough for me, but I do have longer than usual arms.  The important thing is I have no gapping or wind leaks when wearing gloves, so long enough when it counts!

Additional Positives: Warm warm warm! Wore this shoveling the plowed-in driveway, and was sweating buckets within minutes! The fleece lining, as mentioned before, is amazing.  21 degrees & windy this morning walking the dog, and with the hood up I didn't need a hat or scarf!  I will never again buy a coat that doesn't have fleece or some such lining the neck; ditto for fleece-lined pockets positioned behind the down layer (check & check).  The quality of the faux fur on the hood was a pleasant surprise - very soft and pretty.  Love the 4 pockets!  I'm able to run to the store without a purse (huge plus in my book), with enough space for my keys, wallet, glasses and phone, all safe from scratching each other, and still have room left over for my hands :-)

Negatives: While I love the abundance of pockets, the 2 outer ones hang strangely low.  Not an uncomfortable level for hands, but I find walking annoying and sitting impossible with anything solid, like my phone, in an outside pocket (it's just an iPhone 6s, not the bigger plus) because it hits right at the hip joint, something I've never experienced before.  I'll get used to putting my phone in an inner pocket, but that's less convenient, especially since I have to unzip the coat to access those pockets and that lets the cold in.  Brrr!  Really wish this had a placket with snaps like the Chelsea, for those times when I don't want to fully zip up such as quickly dashing from the house to the car, or running to check the mail.  Lastly, a back drawstring on the hood would have been nice.  When up it does come pretty far forward, blocking peripheral vision.  However, I will say that I didn't mind this aspect at all when it was windy!

My specs: I'm 5'6"", 145 lbs, sizes 4/6 and 36a/34c depending on the manufacturer (seriously people, can't we get some uniformity on sizing?!), something of an hourglass frame.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-19 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

Wanted something a little sleeker that wouldn't grab fuzz like fleece. Looked at all the usual players and decided on the Marmot Gravity and overall it's a great jacket. 

The construction is absolutely solid. Fabric has a great feel and look to it, and it's very functional in terms of pockets and layout. It seems warm for what it is, but I'm in TX and have yet to wear it in a true cold environment. I also like/appreciate that the logos are subtle, not so in-your-face as some other brands. I'm paying for your product, not for the chance to advertise for you.

I'm 5'9"", 175"" with a fairly athletic build. I 32"" waist, 42"" coat and normally wear either a large (athletic cut) or medium (regular cut) shirt. I ordered this jacket in Large and I think it's about right. It's not a tight fit, by any means, and the arms are about 3"" too long, but when zipped up it's actually a very tailored fit in the chest/armpits, so I seriously doubt that a Medium would have worked. I don't mind the arms being a little long because with the velcro cuff adjustments it's fine, and with the added length the sleeves don't ride up when reaching/climbing/etc. 

I would rate this jacket a solid 4.5 stars. My only wish is that the fit was a little more trim in the large, but I'm perpetually in size hell (medium too small, large too big) so I don't really fault Marmot on this one. Highly recommend.

Was looking for a comparable jacket that was preferably not North Face since absolutely everyone at my college has them. I always liked the looks of Marmot jackets so decided to try this Gravity, got the light/dark gray color. I'm 5'11"" & 160 & went with a large size since I don't like my jackets too tight & having the options to layer under it. I think it's fit is almost perfect, sleeves a tad long but my only complaint. Looks extremely sleek & understated. Love the way it looks & fits. 

Jacket is pretty warm for a non insulated softshell. Warmer then my Apex Bionic but that may be due to the fact that it's a little tighter fit & the sleeve style is not as baggy as the bionic & sleeve length is a little on the long side protecting my arms/hands, esp in driving winds. Performs great in winds, even cold very strong winds & Marmot has the best DWR I've ever seen if you experience brief downpours. I am completely satisfied going with the Marmot Gravity as my everyday light jacket. In the few weeks I've had it, it stands up to all kinds of weather conditions in Denver (Colorado has huge fluctuations in weather day to day). Initial impressions of build quality is fantastic. My only regret is they no longer sell the Super Gravity (hooded version) of this jacket. It does have a chest pocket like the Bionic but it is internal & has a sleeve pocket at well. 

If your in the market for a non insulated softshell I'd suggest giving this jacket a chance. Great build quality, beautiful styling & warm/very wind resistant for its class. I love my Gravity, wish I would of bought one sooner.

But for my trip to the Arctic I thought they would be the warmest option. After asking around, I went with these, and was very glad I did! I must have abnormally large thumbs, because I had to get the large in order to fit them, but that left some extra room for my fingertips. Even so, they were warmer than they've ever been with gloves, even at -40. And that was just standing around. If I was moving (such as the many times we had to dig cars out of snowbanks), they were almost too warm! I didn't even use the nifty pocket for the handwarmer packs, but they're there if you want them. Expensive?

I whipped these out today in a deep powder day with wind chills between 3 and 10 degrees F. My hands considering how cold it was, did ok. I did wear an additional liner underneath these. The only cold spot I noticed the most was my thumb, however, I have terrible circulation, so I'd still say to buy these if you always have cold hands.

When I was moving, my hands warmed up really well (hiking and actually skiing).  My hands stayed dry all day and the raging wind did not go through the membrane at all!  The gloves' gauntlet system could be wider, I had to really tuck in my sleeves of my jacket in there.  The cinch system on the gauntlet works well and the long strings so I don't lose my mittens is nice.  The mittens also have a clip to stick them together.

Overall, if there was a 4.5 stars I'd give it that. It's a good mitt and worth the $$$ if you have really cold hands.  Your hands will stay dry and warm especially warm if you are in motion at all.","ALUMNI","2010-11-21 00:00:00","",""

"Marmot","Alpinist Jacket - Men's","1444192265",5,"I owned a Montane Polartec Neoshell stretch shell for 1.5 years prior to this purchase, and the taped seams started to delaminate. Warrantied it and got this instead.

I have not used yet in significant weather, but had to write a review. I always have problems finding clothes and jackets that fit given my body type; 5'11"" 147lbs, 38"" chest, long legs long arms (I fit a 34/35 dress shirt), shorter torso in comparison with about a 29.5"" waist. Anything I buy typically I have to size up to get the arm length even though I prefer a tapered fit. The prior Montane I had was almost long enough in the arms in a size small (that was the only size left, so I made do).

Enter this jacket. I was certain a small would not fit given the ""size up"" comments in the reviews, and that my chest size was on the border. But, small was the only one at a deep discount, and I hate overpaying so I took a chance on the small. IT FITS PERFECTLY. Arm length is long enough that I can stretch out with it fully zipped and it goes more than halfway down my thumbs. Built so that arms don't pull with movement. Roomy enough for me to layer my midweight down plus something else, tapered enough that it is not baggy when worn as a stand alone rain shell. Literally, it is like this jacket was designed for my body type, so if you are similar don't hesitate, do it. 

I did buy the Montane Endurance Pro shell to try on with this jacket (small as well). While arm length was about the same, it was just a touch baggy in the wrong places (arms, chest) in a way that just didn't feel good or fitted. Also, the Montanes have a super high collar that literally covers the nose (both the Endurance pro and my prior Polartec neoshell), and I found that wearing goggles I could not zip it all the way up as it was automatic fogging if I did. The Marmot is roomy enough to layer without feeling baggy (hard to explain, both have room enough, but the Marmot is cut just right so it is roomy enough without feeling baggy in those areas - trying on both my wife noted this right away). The Marmot also has a high collar, but standing straight and relaxed it comes to the bottom of my upper lip, which for me is just perfect - can duck my nose in for extra coverage if needed, perfect coverage for no-fog when wearing goggles. 

Features are more than most technical shells, with inclusion of a waist gaiter (seems most alpine shells don't have them, but for the snowboarder that I am it is a plus). Two inside pockets (one is an open mesh for goggles), 4 outer pockets and an extra sleeve pocket to boot. I am in love with this shell. I don't think there is anything I could do to design it better.

Thank you to Marmot for a job well done. Thank you backcountry for the excellent sales team, taking care of my warranty issue, and getting this out to me. You guys rock.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-10-16 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

"Marmot","Minimalist Pant - Men's","3796439",2,"I've had these pants for 4 years now. I initially got them to complement the jacket of the same brand and model, both backpacking and for rain protection when riding my motorcycle.

I can't say I can ever remember a time when these were actually waterproof. They've always leaked through the zipper. They also soak through the seat of the pants, though this could be because I use them on to commute in the rain on my bicycle. However, my biggest frustration is that anytime I get somewhere and take these off after being in the rain, the water on the exterior of the pants somehow makes it to the interior. I'm not sure if it is condensation from the external fabric being cold or if the water is actually soaking through, but I am incredibly uncomfortable every time I have to put these back on after being in the rain once already.

A second frustration is that the leg zippers are not full-length. This makes changing layers when mountaineering difficult, as I am typically wearing crampons.

I also have found these pants to be highly unbreathable, even for gore-tex. This is purely anecdotal, but I feel like the pants are only half as breathable as the jacket.

These pants are water resistant, but by no means waterproof. I've retreated the DWR and still keep running into the same issues. Here's a quick guide of my applications for these pants and the outcomes:

Hiking: Not very breathable, even for Gore-tex. Can't sit in these as the seat of the pants will soak through, even in snow.
Cycling: Again, not breathable. Also, the seat soaks through in as little as 2 miles. 
Motorcycle: Water pools in the crotch, and leaks through the zipper

My takeaway from the Marmot Minimalist products is that Gore-tex paclite technology is incredibly inferior to their pro tech (3L). I've upgraded my upper shell, and I'll be replacing these pants sometime this year as well. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-03 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Marmot","PreCip Jacket - Men's","2817779",4,"Bought the Team Red Jacket XL when it was on sale.
It fit true to size though a bit roomy.  That roominess works well during colder weather so you can wear a base layer and up to a midweight fleece/wool jacket for warmth.
The jacket is very lightweight and can be rolled up into one of the handpockets and the hood can also be rolled into the collar. 
The zipper is not a 2 way zipper in that it can be unzipped from the bottom as well as from the top but that would probably add to the overall cost.
There's no chest pocket but there are 2 hand pockets with mesh lining. 
The jacket is relatively waterproof but it won't stand a continuous downpour as the jacket will get wetted out and you'll feel the cold. The jacket doesn't breathe that well but has pit zips to let moisture out from inside the jacket. 
People may claim that they get wet from wearing the jacket but I'd suspect that it may be their perspiration or sweat  and that they weren't venting the inside of the jacket to let the moisture out.
After a few months, esp. the wet and cold autumn/winter seasons, you'll need to clean the jacket and may have to re-apply the DWR treatment to keep it waterproof. Otherwise, the jacket will naturally lose its waterproofing which will eventually need to be re-applied.
The jacket is light and thin enough to be stowed away into a small pack for travel. 
During the autumn/winter months, I keep it in my car's trunk in case of wet weather.
But the thinness means that you should be careful about using the jacket should you do any active activities as it may tear, say, if used while hiking/backpacking.
It's a relatively jacket when it's on sale usually during the off-seasons in summer and autumn.

It feels like wearing a cozy down blanket and is perfect for those of us that are always freezing. It is puffy without that ""Michelin man"" look. I bought a medium and it fits great; I am 5'2"", 130 lbs and 34DD for reference. The jacket hits right about my knee; the sleeves I've found are the perfect length for me, although I don't have very long arms. The width across my upper back is comfortable in the medium; a couple of other reviews I'd read complained of this being an issue; I am quite petite from shoulder-to-shoulder and after trying on a small returned it for this same reason. It is very warm and perfect for the PNW winters we experience where I live; especially because it snows fiercely here and waterproofing is a necessity; I have not gotten wet once while wearing this out in light/medium intermittent rain. The hood is huge and will definitely aid in keeping the elements off your noggin (while also impairing your peripheral vision); my favorite part of the hood is that not only is it entirely removable, but the fur along the edge is removable as well making the jacket quite versatile. The fleece lining on the interior as well as on the inside of the sleeves (only where your wrists sit) is cozy and appreciated. The fleece lined pockets are deep enough for me to get my entire hand into and are also a favorite of this jacket. The zipper is metal and seems well-made; at first I had a little trouble with it but figured it out before long. The bottom does bell out a bit but not terribly. Mostly the only complaint I have is that a little wind does end up chilling my upper legs. I feel as if I could have gotten the small and this wouldn't have been a problem, but with sacrifices as it didn't fit as well as the medium.

So the XL fits my size-14 body w/ 40DD bra size really well, although if you are my size and DO like to wear thick clothing it may be too tight for you. It's a tiny bit more snug around the hips than up top, as there's a lot of room in the shoulders and back to move comfortably. I am short-waisted and it shows a little bit in the back, but it's much less noticeable than many other coats I've tried recently.

The A-line bottom of the coat that other reviewers didn't like as much is actually really flattering on me and allows me to walk easily without letting the cold in.

I love the fleece sleeves and how the hood can be attached at the front of the neck for really cold/windy/wet days.

That being said...I had the ""fat guy in a little coat"" problem, even with buying a size larger than I normally wear. I have a tall, athletic build, with long arms and broad shoulders. Not only were the arms of this coat too short, I couldn't bend over or move my shoulders without feeling constrained. I had been looking forward to the internal fleece cuffs, but they didn't even make it to my wrists.

Conversely, the torso was too big. I normally wear a size 4 or 6 but purchased a medium to make sure I had room for sweaters. Even with an oversized wool sweater on, the coat was still too big around the waist. If there was some way to cinch it--such as with an internal elastic drawstring--that may have pushed me to keep it despite the shoulder problem.

Before returning it, I did test it outside in 5 degrees F with a brisk wind, and I will say it's windproof and warm as all get out. The hood is deep and the fur trim is soft and pretty. The snaps close securely and the pockets are roomy. There's a cool phone pouch inside with a vent for your headphones. However, the bell flare at the bottom is wide, and guess what, all that cold wind went right up inside the gap as I was walking around, leaving my butt and thighs chilly.

I ordered this coat in S and M, hoping one of the sizes would work. But the sleeves on both were a few inches too short for me, and both sizes were too tight across the shoulder blades, even though the Medium was quite large in the rest of the torso. I also ordered the Marmot Montreal down parka, and had the same shoulder blade width problem. So I guess this brand is not for me. I will have to continue searching for a company that makes jackets to accommodate muscles in small women with long arms.

One other stylistic thing to note is that when on, this coat flares out oddly at the bottom. I think it would look better if it was just a bit shorter (maybe 3-4 inches shorter at the bottom), and didn't have that flare. It just looks awkward.

Initially it was great—I used it on the requisite hiking and backpacking trips, but also as a rain jacket on my motorcycle in the Texas summer showers. Initially it worked incredibly well, but over time, even with reapplication of DWR, it's less than what I need.

When I first got it, I used it heavily in downpours while riding my motorcycle, frequently at 70mph on the freeway. It kept me ALMOST bone dry, with the exception of one little dribble that worked its way through the front zipper. I couldn't complain, I was subjecting it to harsher conditions than it was designed for.

However, over the last three years, I've been using it here in New England as my hiking, backpacking, and mountaineering shell, pulling double duty as my bicycle commuting rain jacket. During this use, the waterproofing has suffered.

in early 2014, one of the seams inside the left armpit started experiencing delamination. I contacted Marmot, and they fixed it up (for free under warranty, I believe). When I received it back, I decided it was probably due for another DWR treatment. I always use spray-on rather than wash-in for membrane products. Shortly thereafter I started to notice that my shoulders felt cold and wet under my pack straps, primarily when biking but also when in the woods. At first I thought it might just be heat conduction from the cold water on the face fabric. But eventually I noticed actual soaking on the garments beneath the jacket. I've retreated DWR several times, and always give the shoulders some extra love, but no matter what I do they always soak through after a short while. 

About two months ago, the seam that Marmot had repaired started delaminating again. The shoulders are still wetting through. 

While this jacket keeps me fairly dry, I can't give it a decent rating because it doesn't live up to expectations. From what I have heard, Gore-tex products should last 10-15 years when treated with care. Mine goes in the wash after every second or third use (unless I'm riding, in which case it gets washed as soon as there's sunshine in the forecast). I retreat the DWR at least once a year. I wash with soap, not detergent, and do a second rinse. These are all care guidelines from both Marmot and Gore-tex. Even with this care, the jacket doesn't hold up as much as I'd like it to.

I got the Dark Spruce color and its rad! Cool other color options too.

I like that it has the look & almost feel of down, but is synthetic. A lot of synthetic jackets have somewhat of a bulky or funky feel to them, this doesn't at all in the slightest. I haven't packed it into a stuff sack or a pack yet, but would imagine I'll have plenty of doing so through the winter for backcountry touring.

The pocket situation is fine - has 2 main outside pockets that are pretty big and one inner one for your phone /  gypsy trinkets / etc.

This is a great mid layer piece or even stand alone for cold weather.

"Marmot","Guides Hooded Down Jacket - Men's","2091790037",5,"This is a big, puffy, and very warm jacket. Gives you that classic Michelin Man look, so hopefully you're into that. It's a great winter jacket for around town. You can throw it on over a t-shirt and be plenty warm in pretty much any temperature, especially if you throw the hood up.

It stuffs into an interior lapel pocket and packs down to about the size of a Nalgene, but it takes some doing to get it in there and get it zipped.

I'd say this is a bit too bulky and definitely too warm for general purpose ski touring/light mountaineering. I never really found an excuse to wear this day touring around the Wasatch this winter other than booting up at the car on cold mornings. However, it's a great piece to have along if you're doing an overnight or a big objective and you've got a bigger pack with some room to spare. 

It's sized quite generously. I selected ""Runs Large"" but I think the sizing is pretty much spot on for a jacket like this, as you generally throw on something like this on top of all your other layers. I wear a slim fitting shell in size medium, and this jacket in size medium fits over it with room to spare. The hood is sized large enough to fit over a mountaineering/skimo helmet, but it would be a tight fit with some bulkier ski helmets. I did a winter ski ascent of Mt.

You can't throw the hood up if you have the front zipped up to your chin, but I've quickly gotten used to that.  It drapes slightly over the buttox so coverage is great.

Initially I wanted to use this as a city/commute jacket since my pooch gnawed through the parka that I normally wore.  Shortly after wearing a couple of times, I thought I should take it ice fishing, as my insulated hard shell that I normally take is far too bulky and large.

The warmth of this jacket blew me away!  It was about 20*, blowing snow, and no sun.  I was wearing thermal underwear, a fleece, and the Marmot and was surprisingly comfortable.  It was confusing at times because my line would be freezing up, but it honestly, didn't feel like it was that cold.

Overall, I love the fact that the material is not shiny and seems very durable.  With some of these down jackets, the material feels garbage-bag like, but not this Marmot.  

I'll probably be looking to get an additional jacket without the hood once spring/summer/fall camping season arrives.

Would I take it on a tree run on my next ski trip?  Probably not.  But for a jacket that looks good in the city and keeps you warm on the lake, I highly recommend it!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-02-29 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Marmot","Guides Hooded Down Jacket - Men's","107305186",5,"Overall: This jacket continually impresses me. It is very light and not bulky at all. It provides a very good range of mobility, (considering I've long arms). In wind, blowing snow, biting cold, I'm warm as a button. I take it with me everywhere I go. 

Warmth: It's extremely warm, especially when layered properly. On its own, I'd say it'll keep you warm in temps as low as the teens and twenties. With a thermal, sweater and shell, you'll be impenetrable. It does a fine job at schicking water off, and is appropriately specified as being water resistant. If you plan on using it for hours on end in wet conditions, I suggest using a fully waterproof shell to combat excess moisture. The inside is well insulated and very comfortable. Doesn't create much static, if at all. 

Features: When fully zipped, the hood rides kind of high around ear level. which can act as an effective wind shield. Every detail of this jacket is well thought out; it's extremely efficient and useful in a variety of applications from snowy excursions to commuting to work. The pockets are well-sized and the zippers themselves are compact. Nothing dangles or pokes. Haven't lost a feather. Doesn't flatten or shrink either.

Drawbacks: Honestly, not many. As mentioned, the hood rides kind of high when not in use. A bit on the shorter side when it comes to torso length.

I live in the Pacific Northwest and these pants have kept me dry in some seriously wet weather (think torrential downpour in Olympic National Park). I bought my first pair (and a PreCip rain jacket) back in 2007 or so if I remember correctly, and the only reason I finally had to give them up is because I tore a massive hole in one of the legs on an old barbed wire fence while out on a plant survey. In light of that experience, I'd recommend these for hiking or backpacking on trails, but not for anything off-trail with the potential for snagging on thorny plants, old barbed wire, etc. The material isn't strong enough to take that kind of beating. 

I would also recommend hand washing any PreCip gear with a gentle detergent to make it last even longer. If you get lazy like I did and throw it in the washing machine repeatedly with the rest of your laundry (and heaven forbid forget it's in there and toss it in the dryer), the waterproof inner coating will eventually start to peel off and your gear will no longer keep you as dry as it once did. That said, it took almost 8 years for that to happen, so I really can't complain.

No, ladies, they won't make you look particularly svelte, especially when you're my height, but I bet you're too busy enjoying the mountain scenery to care about that sort of thing. When it comes to staying dry, you really can't beat them.

Seams make it wearable only two ways without looking boxy or pointed on the head but the graphics are placed just right for this con 

4 stars because the seams are thicker than I anticipated allowing only two ways to wear it but it fits awesome and I'd gift it if someone was looking for a hat. Good job marmot. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-04-11 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Marmot","Tungsten 2p Tent: 2-Person 3-Season","110018587",5,"TL;DR: Backcountry is awesome and so is this tent. Buy one, and buy it here.

Full Version: I bought the Marmot Limelight 2P from this website and have been impressed with not only the customer service Backcountry provides (my CSR is Chris) but also have been stoked with the tent itself. My background with camping is mostly hand-me-down or surplus military gear, and I spent a lot of time in the field while I was in the service myself. Compared to what I know tents *can* weigh, this thing is solidly what I would call ""lightweight"" camping at its finest, though not ultralight--it weighs more than some UL 3 person tents and takes up more space in a pack than a true UL Tent, as well. However, what it does have is a whole lot of upside for a comparably low price. The material is thicker on the fly, floor, and footprint which lends itself to a more durable feel than some UL setups I've seen. It sets up within minutes, the rainfly is great (the eyebrow pole is a huge plus), and the amount of space this thing has for a two-person backpacking tent is insane. The interior space is made even more roomy and useable with the bent pole design. I have to admit, at first I thought it was a gimmick but it does really make the inside feel much roomier than it has any right to feel. Of course, a footprint being included in the price is a huge plus--though I have to say the footprint itself is a smidge larger than it really needs to be. The ventilation is adequate with the rain fly closed and amazing with both vestibules open, even in the Arkansas Summer. I love this tent so much that I have decided to purchase the 1P Tungsten for solo treks and hunting trips. If that doesn't impress upon you how great a product Marmot has with this tent series, I don't know what would.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-09-07 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

I went this weekend with a friend we are both under 5""4 and it was us and my 16lb mini husky. We fit just fine! I was warm and kept my side of the tent door open and she closed hers. Dual doors a plus when im peeing every hr and not having to climb over a sleeping body. The fly was nice as it provided an overhand to store stinky boots and bags. Loved that i could prop one side open for additional venting. 2 compartments for stuff and a little hook at the top to dangle a light or whatever.  Only used it once so 4 stars for now until i test it in wind and rain. 
Pro-light. I carried the tent, my bag, pad, water, all the food/cooking acoutremants etc and my bag didnt feel like i was about to fall over. Doable for my small frame and strength.

I've had this tent for about 4 years now and it is still in great condition. Sometime the zipper catches, but nothing major. 

The tent is extremely easy and fast to set up, and the rain fly as well. The stakes are not good quality, all of mine have bent over time due to using rocks as hammer to nail down the stakes in hard dirt. I am looking in to replacing the stakes soon. 

The only time the mesh walls have been a problem is when I am trying to change in my tent. Other wise its great for star gazing and waking up to a view.  The two doors are fantastic when doubling up in the tent so you dont have to crawl over your partner to get to your side.

A couple miles of incredibly steep snow fields and temperature regulation was perfect. It beads water fairly well as long as you're not in a constant downpour. 10,054 feet at base camp it was around 36 degrees.

I am 6'2'' about 185 pounds. I got the 34 long and initially when I tried them on I was worried they were too long (which is very rare). But once I tried them with boots I realized they were perfect.

1. Back ventilation. Since the back is flat and not very rigid, it molds to your back and if you are sweating at all, your back will become very wet even if you aren't a heavy sweater.

2. The bag really wants to be full. If it's not, then the ""brain"" portion clips loosely to the bag (can't cinch down tight) and sags over. If you have more weight in the brain then it kind of flops down especially when you rest the bag down.

3. I wish the shoulder strap adjusts had a way to manage the excess strap like the waist band does.

"Marmot","Kompressor Plus 20L Backpack","5491508",5,"Love this Day Pack!  I've been looking for a lightweight pack to carry stuff around for day trips / hiking.  I broke this in over a long weekend at Drake Bay, Costa Rica. I was able to carry my 2L Platypus, a Nikon D5200 (entry lvl DSLR), some fruits, cell phone and my ipad, without any issues.  The hydration pack fit well and was comfortable but I did need to pad the bottom of the hydration pack with a small face towel to cover the closure so it wouldn't feel like I had a rock in the middle of my back.  There is an opening at the bottom to put the hose through, but I couldn't get it to work comfortably so I just had it snake out of the top of the pack (seems like it's a design issue with Platypus, not the pack).

The fabric is quite thin, but seems incredibly sturdy. It's not something that will keep your things dry, so plan to use a dry bag if there is a chance you'll be in the rain or on a boat.  It's raining in Costa Rica, so I did just that for my electronics. 

I did a 4 hr hike up and down a beach one night and that was the only time I felt the straps uncomfortable with the weight, but that was the longest I spent with this on my back.   

I also went for a full day snorkeling excursion, got the pack soaked and was delighted to find it completely dry the next morning when I had to head back home. 

Once I got home, I took out the insert and threw this in a sweater bag and in the wash and it came out like new... no issues washing whatsoever.  

This really is a great buy for someone travelling with limited luggage space but needing an option to carry your stuff during the day.

They have the Primaloft insulation which is very, very, very warm.  As soon as you put your hands in these gloves you can feel the warmth and I wore these the other day when it was 20 degrees and my hands started to get too hot. The inside of the gloves are very soft and the long cuffs can go over the sleeve of a jacket. There are cords by the wrist and at the end of the glove that can be tightened to keep the cold and snow out. As far as sizing going I would recommend ordering a size down, according to Marmot's size chart I should have been a medium but they were a little to big and the smalls fit a lot better so they do run a little large in my option. The reason why I gave these gloves four stars was because the first pair that I ordered had a small rip in the stitching where the top layer of the gloves meets the palm in the right glove where the index finger would be so make sure to look at the stitching before you take the tags off. Upon seeing this I called Backcountry and they gave me a free return label and sent me a new pair right away and this pair that I have now has been great.

Only mittens will fit the bill for these kind of temperatures and my previous REI brand ones weren't cutting it.

For mittens I prefer an all in one construction rather than removable liners and these seemed to best fit the bill. After 2 winters using them I am very happy with my choice (especially at the price I was able to get at Backcountry).

"Marmot","Long Hauler 38-110L Duffel","106284436",5,"I purchased this duffel right before I went on a three day canoe trip in Alaska. During the trip, it rained pretty much the entire time, and I put this bag through just about everything the Alaskan wilderness threw at me. 

Let me first start off by saying that this is not a dry bag, and is not supposed to be a dry bag. A lot of people buy this duffel and others similar to it because they are looking for a dry bag to keep all their stuff nice and cozy. If I were rating this as a dry bag I wouldn't praise it so highly. That being said, it does a pretty good job of keeping your stuff dry for being a duffel bag.

As far as cons go, the only thing that seems sketchy about this bag is the clips on the backpack straps are small and plastic. (That being said, I abused this bag pretty well over the weekend and they held up great).

As far as pros go, this bag is awesome for pretty much anything and everything except scuba diving. It's perfect for simple traveling with lots of room and compression straps that help the bag pack down nicely. On my canoe trip, I purchased the Large size, 75L, and I was able to pack clothes and food for 3-4 days, stove, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, and a tent. It rained every day and my bag was sitting in the bottom of the canoe the entire time. While a little bit of water eventually did seep through the parts of the bag without laminate, for the most part my stuff stayed nice and dry. (All my stuff was in neoprene bags anyway so it didn't matter.) Even though the bag got soaked, it dried out fairly quickly every night. My favorite part about the bag are the carrying handles on each end of the bag, they actually helped tremendously when I was picking it up and moving it around.

Bottom line, this is the best duffel bag I've owned. This is a very heavy duty duffel bag that you can beat up and not feel bad about, and it's great for traveling in general. 5 stars!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-06-15 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

The Cons were that the backpack straps were a little clumsy and uncomfortable--to be fair, this is a duffle bag with backpack straps, not a backpack--and if you extend the straps into a duffle, they work properly.

You know the deal when taking on a carry on.  You don't.  You leave it on the Ala-carte luggage rack outside the airplane and when you land, you wait for them to offload your bag out of the hold and then pick up your back from the cart.  Alongside 50-70 other people. It's a zoo.  And if it's raining, you get wet.  I'd rather have my bag with me in the cabin, so I opted for the Long Hauler Small size.  Loaded up, it fits in the overhead compartment just right.  The medium would not squish in there unless it was half empty.  The ergonomics of the strap is great for carrying it and a backpack/computer bag.  The option for carrying it like a backpack is appealing as well.

There is one set of straps for duffel carry as well as backpack style carry, which is a cool idea, but both options suffer because they had to compromise. If the carry if duffel style but the bag isn't full, it will sort of fold in half because the carry handles are attached at each end of the bag. And when you wear it like a backpack, it suffers because the two attachment points at the bottom of the straps are too close together and actually sit between the bag and your back, which can be uncomfortable if you've got a lot of weight in the bag.

My old Plasma jacket had true baffled shoulders. They were also reinforced. The Plasma also had pockets with a flap over them.

Most amount of down I could find in any jacket barring high altitude jackets with waterproof shells. The construction seems very high quality and full featured.  The velcro on the storm flap and collar are a nice touch and very useful without adding real weight.  The down it distributed very well, and there are no thin spots anywhere.  Reasonably light an packable for how warm it is.  The length is nice and it has a drop tail that completely covers my butt. I will be using it as a belay jacket for cold days cragging, bitter cold days bouldering, and backpacking in the mountains in winter.  This is the warmest jacket that is suited for those type of activities.  Excellent value if you get one on sale compared to other companies down parkas.

"Marmot","Greenland Baffled Down Jacket - Men's","101161679",5,"I have a sickness - ice climbers are all gear junkies, but I am truly a fanatic. I own WAY too many down coats, from the Patagonia sweaters to the EB Peak XV. This is simply the best of the lot, and here's why:
  
1. Best down to weight ratio. Almost 11 oz. of down to ~31 oz. weight (mine is L).
 
2. Lofts incredibly. Fills all available air space, but completely unrestrictive.
 
3. Compresses well. The light shell and super high quality down crush down.
 
4. Great design. The belay zip works, and the flash pocket is key. The hood is perfect.
 
5. The baffles work. It is not GWS or Pertex, but I don't care - in hurricane force winds I feel nothing, even when the wind chill is -40F. If you're as dumb as me to be climbing (or worse, belaying) in those conditions, well, better have this coat.
 
Remember 2 things:
 
1. Don't worry about the down - if you need this coat, there is no liquid water anyway.
 
2. It's not burly, so watch those points. I bring a stuff sack to protect it in my pack.
 
I simply love this coat. It's like a wearable sleeping bag. I consider it essential survival gear.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-04-20 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

Turns out the weather was pretty spectacular and the Greenland might have been more than enough (roughly 20* low). But i was super warm when we stopped and really comfortable the entire way up. Rocked this jacket at the summit in warmer than expected weather and was comfortable with the jacket unzipped.
Now the technicals:  
Zippers engage well,
double zippers means you can zip up from bottom to access harness, or fly.
Big pocket for nalgene is great for that summit rest stop.
Baffles are massive and puffy keeps you super warm
Hood is huge!
cinches are great for keeping face warm
Stuffs into its own cavernous pocket for a really nice camp pillow. Not too firm, not too soft and almost half the size of a queen!

Seriously If you wear a large go medium. I would say in most cases go down a size for this jacket. 

To start off this jacket is pretty awesome. Feels big and heavy enough to stand up for all cold. The snowskirt definitely adds a warmth factor by trapping the heat. Its not extremly puffy, but has that puffy down jacket feeling inside. I just used it in 30F snow/sleet and felt toasty with just a tshirt underneath. The hood feels great and well insulated keeping my head perfectly warm. Mesh Inside pocket is huge which will be great for goggles when skiing. 

Cons: the outside pockets--
Their big and the zipper starts at the top so to comfortably use them as hand pockets they will be open and leaving gaps for blowing snow/sleet. I dont know why they didnt just have the zippers start from the bottom..... 

Overall this jacket was totally worth the price I paid  (220 or so) and the zippers are my only complaint. I went through a couple jackets till I landed on this one and its for sure a winner. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-14 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

Set up both 6P and 4P Halo in my living room first to decide--thought with future festivals and trips *with* the 2 dogs we might need the bigger one.  Although the standing room in the 6P would be great during a festival, definitely overkill for my kind of camping.  So we went with the 4P.

Set up on the Halo is ridiculously easy.  We kept having a habit of arriving at our destination late, and rushing against darkness to set up. Never a struggle with this tent. Super straightforward design. Even my inexperienced partner got the hang of it right away.

I also love the color. Bright and cheery place to be.

Summer in Colorado at altitude means both cold and hot--the tent wasn't bad for both. Good ventilation. Although, when it got hot, we just got out. Good holding in warmth. 

Nice size. It'll be fine when we have both medium-sized dogs. At that point we'll probably move gear to vestibule.

Over eight months we slept in the tent for about six months, car camping in the US and Canadian National Parks, Cycle touring in Europe and Backpacking in New Zealand. We put the tent through hell, torrential rain night after night, blistering heat, sand storms, exceptionally strong winds. The tent is fantastic, however has a few design improvements needed. The floor could do with being more waterproof, the side pole sleeve sockets collect water/condensation that then runs into the tent. The zips don't like dusty conditions and hence the teeth become out of sync both inner and outer zips, (think this may be because of the rounded shape of the entrance). We also used a foot print that proved no good when you wake up to your camp ground squelching, large damp areas appear inside the floor area. Well L would buy this tent again having said all this, no tent could stand up to what we put it through. What a fantastic memory this tent gave us.

Our first camping trip with this tent was on the Olympic coast in WA, high humidity and high winds. The forecast called for 70%+ humidity for the two days we were there. Let me start off by saying by 9pm there was a layer of dew on my vehicle and the exterior of the tent...that is how moist it was outside. For the two days we had the tent up in these conditions it had ZERO condensation on the inside. We even only had the rain fly vents open and left the lower vents closed. With two people and two dogs we didn't get any condensation!

This is not about the Halo, but they do not have the capstone anymore and I wanted everyone to know how Marmot does not honor warranty.(Purchased the Capstone 6) I purchased a Marmot because I have had cheap tents that leaked in the rain. The 1st camping trip all was ok as it did not rain. But in October 2014 using the tent for the second time. After a night of moderate rain, we discovered the floor had leaked in several places and especially under our sleeping pads and 2 large puddles of water in one of the corners. There were 2 other Marmot tents in our group (Halo 6) no leaks. Called Marmot and all we heard was what we must have done wrong to cause the tent to leak. We return the tent and of course we had to pay shipping of $94. So now I have around $750 in the tent.  
	Anyway, Marmot calls saying that we must have put the footprint upside down. And all the water in the corner was because we did not put the tent up correctly. I then told him that the floor is supposed to be waterproof, he did not deny this but just said they pressure checked the floor and it did not leak. I informed him that everyone else was just using a Walmart tarp under their tent. He said the puddles of water were caused from me not setting up the tent correctly and allowing the fly to touch the tent. He said the fly was waterproof but the tent was not. If the fly was waterproof how did water get in the tent as the water could not have penetrated the fly? Therefore, the fly would have to be defective or no water could have got to the tent. The fly was not touching the tent. Also I would like to add that the other 2 Marmot tents were not using even half of the tie downs and the fly had to touch their tents. We also sent Marmot the pictures of all the water in the tent from that morning. We even requested they replace it with their less expensive Halo 6 that others with us had and experienced no leaks, but they would not do anything.

Most other details are what I expect from Marmot. I decided to try the Ouray because I needed a 0-deg bag, and I like Marmot product. Lots of good things as others mentioned, and I'm sure it would have been great, but for a couple things that didn't do it for me.
First, the fill on the bottom did not fill as much as floor models I saw prior to buying this bag. I fluffed and fluffed as much as possible; let the bag hang for over a week; fluffed some more; but the bottom fill never fully filled the baffles. I could see light coming through many spots. Perhaps I got a bag that didn't get filled properly.
Second, I don't like the way the foot box is designed into the bag. It's a bit hard to describe. The bigger space/more fill is good, but getting my feet into the bag is not as smooth as I'd expect. The zipper stops perhaps 12"" or more from the bottom of the bag. And it's here where where the trapezoidal foot box begins to take shape. But rather than the bag smoothing down from the body to the foot box, there are these actual stopping points you can feel. If you mis-direct your foot on entry (lights on or off), you could jam your toe into this stopping point. I don't mind getting used to new features on gear, but re-training myself on how to get into my sleeping bag isn't really one of them. I camp a lot; so it's not like I can just ""live with it"" for the few times I camp.
And the zipper not going down even to within 6"" of the bottom of the bag won't let you open the bottom of the zipper a bit to let in a bit of cool air if your feet overheat.
So except for the low fill on the bottom of the bag and oddities of the foot box, this bag would have been great for me. Giving it 3 for these two issues.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-05-08 00:00:00","I returned this product before using it",""

Marmot makes the best bags in my opinion and the Ouray Women's bag is no exception. The pillowy down keeps her very warm and is treated with DWR to combat moisture so the down will loft and continue to deliver warmth in more humid/wet environments. The small details really matter on a great sleeping bag. The draft collar system in this bag is one of the best that I have seen. If you don't know what a draft collar is, it is the small barrier in the bag around your upper chest/neck that keeps cold air from entering the bag via creating a barrier. The draft collar in this bag is well placed, has a cinch and perhaps most importantly is not noticeable when cinched down to allow for comfortable sleep. Unless you are an ultra-light style backpacker you will not notice the extra weight (ounces) or size in terms of packability.

First, it sheds feathers big time! So disappointing. By the fourth or fifth wear, this coat is not nearly as warm as it was at first and I believe that is because SO much of the down has leaked out. Feathers constantly jab into my skin, which is super uncomfortable. 
Second, the coat doesn't zip or button down far enough. The coat is long, a great length actually, but the zipper stops inexplicable short. The short zipper allows strong drafts to travel up under the coat, making it not nearly as warm. Big bummer. 
Lastly, the coat is super noisy. I don't really mind it too much, but other people have commented that they can ""hear me coming from a mile away."" It seems to annoy people around me, so that isn't great either. 
I have a small head, so I don't have issues with the hood and can comfortably wear a beanie under it without any problems. I also think the sleeves are great and I love the fleece lining in them. The fleece lining in the pockets is also fantastic. 
Ultimately, I also have the Patagonia ""Down with it"" coat, and it is much warmer and doesn't shed feathers constantly. It isn't nearly as wind/waterproof as the Marmot Chelsea, but hey, the feathers stay in and it is warmer, and it zips down far enough.

Whatever I wear under the coat is covered in feathers when I take the coat off. I can see tons of feathers sticking through all the seams on the inside. It is really, really, really disappointing, especially because I didn't buy this coat on sale (because I temporarily lost my Patagonia ""down with it"" and needed a replacement immediately). The coat is also really squeaky like other reviewers have mentioned, but I don't mind that. I do mind all of the feathers leaking out all the time after only a second or third time wearing the coat. I have now had this coat for about 2 months, and have worn it several more times and have to say it isn't nearly as warm as it was at first. I imagine this is due to so much of the down coming out. It has also gotten fairly uncomfortable to wear because the feathers jab through whatever I am wearing and into my skin. It is not awesome to have sharp feathers jab you all over your back. If the feathers stayed in the coat, this would be the most awesome coat ever and I would absolutely love it and rave about it.

"Marmot","Strato Pillow","107515141",5,"Where do I even start with this pillow?

Let's start with why I HATE most of the inflatable backpacking pillows on the market. Most inflatable pillows leave me with one major issue: I really am not a fan of feeling like I am laying face down on a plastic bag the whole night, which is typically my biggest complaint, I can't sleep on my stomach without feeling like I am suffocating. 

This pillow? It solves that issue with the two cutouts, which are perfectly situated to provide stomach sleepers with space to breath. 

The two cutouts also help to cut down on the weight of the pillow as well — at 1.41 ounces, this thing is super light and well worth the ounces for the amount of comfort it provides on trail.

This pillow is incredibly easy to inflate. For me it takes about 3-4 breaths to fully inflate, but my trail buddy, Bellows, can inflate this sucker in two breaths. (Wonder why he got that nickname. LOL)

I was a little worried about the fabric being lightweight and therefore a little bit more susceptible to tearing, ripping, etc. It obviously isn't made out of the most rugged material, but it seems like unless you are being incredibly careless and sleeping on jagged rocks (which would be less than average anyways), it should hold up just fine. I also like that it came with a convenient little stash pouch for when I am not using it, just to provide it with that little extra layer of protection when it is in my pack with the rest of my gear.

All in all, I'd highly recommend this pillow — particularly for stomach and side sleepers — for backpacking. I've been sleeping like a baby since I bought mine.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-05-10 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

Lastly, and unfortunately what killed the bag, was I used this as a work bag, putting a heavy laptop and other items into it day after day. My thoughts are it just wasn't built for that type of use. A shoulder strap on the bag ripped off, and that was the end of my love affair with this bag.

"Marmot","Ultra Kompressor 22L Backpack","106396981",5,"First I was looking for a bag that I could use as my daily bag for running shoes and discs and snacks and drinks and layers etc...  I also wanted that pack to be my technical pack as well.  Hence the Ultra Kompressor.  After exhaustive research and wanting the most bang for my buck I settled on this exact little beauty.  I bought the black model.  

I've had it about a month and a half.  It's my daily carry.  I'd be lost without it at this point.  It carries exactly what I need and is very asthetic and streamlined not seeming bulky at all.  This pack always finds a way.  It's incredible.  When I need just a little more space it has it.  It duals as my diaper bag as well which looks much more hardcore than my florql design actual diaper bag.  Fits all mine and my sons stuff for zoo trips and jogs.

Then the weekend rolls around and its time to hit the trails.  This bag converts flawlessly.  It's slightly more robust shoulder straps have no trouble handling a 15-20lb load.  The shoulder load stabilizer straps make all the difference in the world, conforming the pack for your back for the most stable possible carry.  The removeabe waist belt stops the side to side sway combined with the perfect sized sternum strap turn this pack into an extension of your body.

Every review mentions if you're a minimalist you might be able to use this pack for an overnighter.  This is seriously underclassing this pack as a daypack.  I hardly consider myself minimalist and this pack handles everything I need perfectly.  Marmot summer synthetic bag, grand trunk skeeter beeter, warbonnet superfly, imusa pot with titanium mug and plastic pudding tub inside, extra shorts and shirt, down hoodie, an entire extra bugnet for my buddy, a few mountain house meals, some trailmix, coffee,  muffin mix and some tuna and noodle packets........ ::inhale::.... My wallet, phone, charging stick, socks, sandals, BUG SPRAY, tent stakes, headlamp, biofreeze stick(like bengay), collapsible half liter canteen and 1 quart of water.  All of that inside this ""daypack"".  

I've had it out 2 weekends so far and its been incredible.  My shoulders and back haven't been strained or ached at all. It carried the load flawlessly.  Well, well thought out pack.  I just keep thinking bang for your buck with this pack.  Oh, to boot even the laptop sleeve pad came in useful to sit around the fire when I didn't feel like sitting in the dirt or retiring back to the hammock.  This pack always comes through.

If you want a one pack option for school, diaper bag, gym bag yet be technical enough to tackle rugged terrain or climb, you will not find a better pack, especially not at this value.  It's a no brainer if you're even considering buying it, buy it.

I bought this pack myself and no one paid or asked me to write this review.  I just love this pack this much and there isn't a ton of practical in use information on this pack.  I hope this helps.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-08-10 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

The main poles being joined make for a somewhat awkward setup due to their size but setup is still super easy.

"Marmot","Limelight Tent: 4-Person 3-Season","107329135",5,"We just used this on a 3-day camping trip in Vermont and it held up beautifully. The first night, we were caught in a 12-hour downpour. There were times we woke up to so much water coming down that it sounded like someone was dumping buckets on the tent. Even with all the splatter and water, we stayed dry. There were a couple of damp spots on the floor of the tent, but certainly no wet spots. With the ability to remove the rainfly very easily, we were able to air everything out easily once the rain quit. The tent does have tabs on the sides to pull the walls out. We did this after the first night using the extra stakes and some extra rope we had. The tent became even more waterproof. No moisture at all when we got more rain later in the weekend. The size of the tent was also perfect for us. We had two sleeping pads, a large dog bed for our golden retriever, and our large Patagonia duffel in there with plenty of room to spare. We did get a waterproof fleece blanket to protect the floor of the tent from our dog's nails. Plenty of pockets for belongings, awesome headlamp pouches to project light throughout the tent, and a great hook to hang a little lamp from overhead. The vestibules were extremely useful in the rain. We could keep all shoes outside of the tent and keep them dry. Just be sure to check for spiders before putting your feet in. It's also possible to crouch and close the vestibule before opening the tent door to keep the water out. The tent took about 10-15 minutes to put up. Couldn't ask for anything better.

"Marmot","Limelight Tent: 4-Person 3-Season","109477382",4,"  We put this tent to the test during a very rainy weekend in the Smokies. It rained all weekend, but we stayed nice and dry.
  The extra poles on the tent really do keep the end walls more vertical and give you a lot more usable floor space. The vestibules aren't huge, but they have enough space to leave your shoes out to dry. 
  The tent is easy to put up, but I don't like the little plastic piece at the top of the tent that holds the larger poles together. We broke this piece the first time we put the tent up. Marmot sent us a replacement, but it was the wrong size. I've put up many a tent, and this thing just makes it more complicated.
  The doors have four zipper pulls each, which I think is a bit excessive, but we're not using this as a backpacking tent. The vestibule doors have two zipper pulls, which worked really well for exiting and entering the tent in the rain, as you don't have to open the vestibule doors all the way to enter the vestibule. You can open the top, step in and close it back up over you very quickly and the tent stays taught.
When we finished our camping trip, I was able to take the tent down in the rain, while remaining under the rain fly. It worked surprisingly well and kept me drier than taking it down in the rain. You'll still get wet taking down the fly, but it's still an improvement.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-05-05 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

"Marmot","Val D'sere Down Jacket - Women's","109186982",5,"I wasn't sure if I should get this coat - Knowing it was down I wasn't sure if it would be waterproof enough, and reading reviews online (not just on here but other sites too) the general consensus seemed to be ""good, but not great"". I also wasn't sure if it would be warm enough as I'm always cold and jackets other people consider warm, I don't. I had also read reviews that the sleeves were short, which is true if you have long arms. I am 5'2 and don't have long anything so it worked for me. I will say that it has the velcro straps on the end of the sleeves, so you can make them really tight to trap in warmth, and makes the sleeves feel a bit longer.

On to why I freaking love this jacket...

Number one, it's incredibly warm. I'm from the PNW so I'm not using this for Minnesota winters or anything, but it's by far the warmest piece of clothing I own. It was below freezing recently (like high 20s F) and snowing, and I used this jacket with just a T shirt underneath and was completely fine outside for like an hour. It's very cozy and the pockets especially are soft and warm inside. The pockets are front loading, but I found myself liking them because less stuff falls out. Another major factor I love is all the different pockets - almost all of them are zippable which is awesome for stuff you don't want to lose, like keys or money or a debit card or whatever. Really functional. Plus it has a down filled hood which is a biiiig plus. I like the length of this jacket, it goes to the point where it's touching the very tops of my thighs and that's the perfect length in my opinion. I'm not a huge fan of the really long coats/jackets but the short ones just don't provide the warmth this does. I wear it almost every day, it's my go to, it's a flattering fit and super warm without looking like michelin man.

Very minor cons: hood is kinda small when you're wearing a hat, could stand to be a little bigger/go out further to protect your face from the elements. Also know that if you're looking for waterproof - I would say, after testing this in rain for long periods of time, it's more of ""very water resistant"". Does fine, retains warmth well even in a good dose of rain. But torrential downpours for several hours? Get a waterproof shell to go over. I don't think it could necessarily stand up to extremes like that. One last very minor con if I'm gonna be picky - there's no underarm venting, so I've found myself sweating if I wear it in a place that's not cold enough for too long. Then again, that means its doing its job well of being a really warm jacket, so...

Yeah. Love this jacket. Got it in black and it goes great with everything. Already have recommended this to a few friends. Really glad I purchased it.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-06 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Marmot","Val D'sere Down Jacket - Women's","108134726",3,"I received the ""dark raspberry"" jacket and found the colour to be significantly pinker than the red colour pictured. Other sites also had the same ""red"" picture. It is a dark pink and to me not nearly as sophisticated a colour. I have returned it.

I am an Australian size 10, (which I think is a U.S. 8); 138lbs; 172cm tall. 

I already have a Sierra Designs Dridown Stretch Hooded Jacket from 2014 in size medium, and it is a great fit.

I bought the medium in this Val D'sere, and found it to be a good fit for lots if layering underneath, and even with no layering, it seemed to look like a good enough fit (not baggy). If they made a size between medium and small, I would ideally go for that - it would possibly be a more feminine fit but still have enough room for layering - I am small-chested and this jacket makes me look like I have no chest at all. 

The sleeves were a good length - I thought they might be a bit short based on other reviews but they were fine. My arms aren't short but aren't ape arms either. (I must say that my Dad's new Haglofs Bivvy III jacket has arms for apes, they go right over his hands. My partner has ape arms and he loved the Bivvy's arm length.) Perhaps if I sized down, the arms may be shorter, but I think wouldn't be too bad.

The hood is nice, it doesn't hug my face and has a little visor sticking out, which really good goretex rain jackets have to stop rain getting in one's eyes. Not that I'd wear this as a rain jacket as such, of course it isn't made for that.

The jacket went well past my bum and it is almost a parka in length.

Possibly overkill for Sydney winters, though it would be great on the really cold days or at someone's house who doesn't have heating, when sitting around not moving. That's a big thing for me to say, as I get really cold really easily.

Awesome bag. I used this bag for plenty of winter backpacking trips in Alaska, and I couldn't be happier. It has always kept me warm and comfortable. It's easy enough to vent if it's not too cold outside (I usually partially unzip at around 0 degrees). The baffles and collar work great, and I even found the hood worked well. The bag typically collects a decent amount of frost during the night when I use it, but it has never felt damp when I unpack it for the next night. I've used this bag down to -20, and I slept great in a base layer and a balaclava. My only real complaint with this bag is that the zipper has a tendency to catch the fabric, so it can be annoying to fully zip when you're tired and freezing. Still, definitely a great bag for anyone going somewhere seriously cold.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-06-08 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

An issue I have with most rain jackets is the lack of venting and breathability. It feels like you're wearing a trash bag and cooking underneath. Marmot's NanoPro allows the Magus to provide breathability while maintaining reliable waterproofness, and the generous pit zips allow for extra air flow when needed. 

If you're looking for a versatile, packable, and never-leave-home-without-piece, the Magus will make a great addition to your pack or camping duffel!

It has plenty of room in the top and shoulders, but no stretch in the waist, and has a pretty straight shape overall.  I can't size up as I was already trying on the XL, but I think sizing up would be too large in the shoulders anyway. 

Would love to see a version with a little more curve in the shape, and some stretch inserts in the bottom hem.

"Marmot","Evie Shirt - Women's","106248007",4,"Great active shirt. I love the color, I love the loose fit (although others may be inclined to order a size down), the length is perfect as it is long enough to cover your low back as you bend over, but not so long as to be a shirt dress. It hits just below the belt loops. The material is soft, light, and airy, but not overly flimsy or see through. The side panels are ribbed until breast height, then there is an open honey comb weave from the breast line, through the arm pit , and ending at the sleeve terminus. This allows for fantastic ventilation and rapid (rapid) dry time after your run. The honey comb knit also runs on the back panels visible in the pictures. 

The only qualm I have so far with this shirt are the tags. Yes, so much so that I am docking a star. The tag at the neck is fine, although I feel like marmot needs to get on the tagless bandwagon. It's the side seam tagS!!! There are more tags sewn in here than there are pages in a first grader's assigned reading.  Seriously.... There are TEN(!!!!!) of them!!!!! On a SHIRT!!!!! So, ok, no buggy you say, just cut them off. But here's another catch,  they are sewn directly on with the surging of the seam itself, as in inline with the seam. Not in addition to the seam. If you cut the tags in their entirety off you will have a hole. Then you get to sew the hole shut which, if your sewing skills are like mine, WILL be noticeable. This is of course the route I will take as there are TEN (!!!!!) side itch causing tags on this bad boy, and to leave the tag remnants would be to leave a wad that will continue to make your side itch (yes, I tried this first).

So there ya have it. A great shirt with a penchant for teaching you new languages across its ten tags.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-08-04 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

If you're familiar with the Arc'teryx Atom, this jacket has a similar soft, stretchy outer fabric. The cinch at the bottom prevents it from riding up under your shell, which I find is something I run into frequently.  The pockets are up high so you can still access them if you're wearing it under your backpack or under a harness. 

Fit: 

I would say this jacket fits true to size. I'm 5'7', 126 LBS, and have broad shoulders so I usually have to size up in jackets, which always leaves unwanted fabric around my torso, but then I can actually move my arms so that's a win.

Pros:
-Very warm and great for dry weather activities
-Cute jacket
-Has inside pocket, which is great for keeping your ski pass, or phone/wallet/money
-Fabric is very durable
-When soaked it still stays insulated
-If it happens to drizzle it has a SLIGHT ability to bead off the jacket, however that is not this jackets strong suit.
-Has a big hood suitable to work with a helmet.
-Fit true to size
-Warm and perfect for skiing.
-It has an oversized quality to the body, which works great for layering with sweatshirts or sweaters. 
-Great for technical and casual use.

Cons:
-This will get soaked if you are in a humid environment â also gets wet in the rain, and snow (as to be expected) works great with a shell.
-The jacket, worn with the wrong pants, can either make you look like a 90âs mom, or a child over bundled in ski gear â however I would take functionality over fashion, and the functionality of this jacket definitely outweighs the fit.

But I feel it's lacking just a little bit, so I snatched up the Marmot Astrum hoping it would leave me satisfied as most all the other Marmot gear I own has. 

First, I must start by saying this puppy is WARM. It's really nice on fall days, only really need a t-shirt underneath, so I imagine it's going to be a key player in the colder months to come. 

Second, the stretch of the material lets me know that it's going to keep up with all I need it to so and I won't feel like I'm going to tear through it.

Third, the pockets are nice, with a little fuzzy lining to add that lil extra somethin' somethin' on colder days. Also, it's nice having an internal pocket, I haven't had that in a jacket like this before. I just toss my phone in there and go!

Just about my only complaint I can think of is that sizing across the board in Marmot coats isn't universal. In other jackets, like the Marmot Jena Down, I need a large for my hips. But with this I felt I could have gone with the medium instead as I seem to be swimming a little in this large. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-10-31 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

Despite what it says in the specs, this is not angel wing movement (at least my March of 2016 version did not). This jacket is too narrow in the shoulders and has a ""Euro slim"" style arm cut where it is not designed to be lifted. That is too bad because if it had angel wing movement it would be a five star jacket. On specs, I got large but traded to XL and it's still too narrow in shoulders. For reference I am 6'4""  & 185 lbs. I wear a 16/35 shirt and a 42L jacket. 

Some positives
Great pockets!  Hand pockets have fleece lining. Zippered external chest pocket is a must in any jacket and this has it. A zippered internal pocket as well as a big mesh drop in pocket. 

Nice hood. Slim fit and not for a helmet. 

It is a nice light jacket. But it's not a very warm jacket. Think good for a fall day or when hiking in winter. But you will need something more when you stop. There is no way this keeps you warm sitting at a Packer game in January. 

As a thinner jacket it works well in town as well as on the trail. I really want to like it but the arms are a real downfall. For outdoor use I moved to a Marmot Quasar hoody. It is both warmer and has a much better fit that sizing is correct and a large fit perfectly.

I bought a medium and it does run short in the torso. I would say for me it is at least 2-3 inches shorter than what I like. The lack of angel wing movement made it so that when I raised my arms the jacket rode up to almost my belly button. The hood fits tight around your head so it is nice and snug(esp with a hat) but a little awkward. The plastic cinch pieces are kind of awkward as well. 

It is comfortable and I am wearing it now, it has awesome pockets that are spacious!  The casual fit is nice as I can wear it to the office and not look too out of place :) . I'd say I won't return it at the moment. I do have long arms and the sleeves fit great. It is a Marmot so the quality is on point. 

I wore it out in a very windy and rainy night and the jacket held up well. I was warm all night (about 40 degrees, windy, mod. rain) with only a t-shirt on under it. It repelled the rain well too.

I bought a pair of marmot snowpants too and one of the snaps doesnt work as of today. I live in Chicago and take public transportation, and after freezing temperatures the last couple years, I wanted something ultra warm and waterproof.  Wouldn't you know the temperatures have been warm this year so I have maybe worn this coat a couple few times a week. Hand warmer pockets are on the very front of the jacket, are too small for my hand and not warm at all. Big pockets in the front are good for storage but just lined with satin. I don't always like to wear gloves so this was disappointing. Hope you have a good hat too, because the thin stretchy nylon pull strings on the hood don't tighten it. On a windy day you will feel wind in your hood if you don't have a hat on. 
Like I said, I've already had a snap fall off the front flap that goes over the zipper. I like to wear it in zipped and just snapped closed for ventilation because this coat is an oven. Which is good. But how much do you wanna pay for a coat with nothing to warm your hands in and nothing to keep your head warm thats going to fall apart in less than one winter season? Not 500. 
Marmot has a warranty so I'll be sending it in, but that leaves me without a winter coat. In CHICAGO WINTER.  If you can afford to buy this coat, spend the extra 150-200 and get a Canada Goose.

I shopped around  for jackets with the specifications I wanted - down, water resistant/proof, thigh to knee length- and eventually settled on Marmot because of price. I initially purchased both the Geneva and the Chelsea to compare and I ended up sending the Chelsea back. What I liked about the Geneva- unlike the other reviewer, the wrist cuffs are snug, the handwarmer pockets have magnetic closures, the cargo pockets are well placed and the fleece lining.  The lining in this coat gives it a warm coziness that I would compare to being wrapped up in bed on a cold morning.  Performance so far- after last winter's steady below freezing temperatures I decided this year to invest in good winter coat. I spend a lot of time outside especially since I'm the designated dog walker in my house.  This coat has kept me warm and comfortable  on those long walks despite temps being in the single digits and teens.  
What I don't like but can deal with: the zipper is two way which, because of the length, causes the zipper to start ""unzipping up""  when I sit down.

When you place your hands into the pockets fully (without a pack on) the positioning causes large amounts of stress to the lower part of the pocket stitching and zipper and consequently causes one's arms/shoulders to be uncomfortably positioned or makes you look like you are half cocked to do the chicken dance. This detracts from the overall diverse functionality of the jacket for me. More so, when the pockets are loaded, with or without a pack, the depth issue can cause multiple problems.

Long version: I like this jacket and Marmot's M3 material so much that when my first Estes was unfortunately misplaced when traveling, I did't hesitate to replace it.  The breathability and stretchability of the M3 material means this jacket is comfortable when active and I typically don't feel the need to take it off when I get back indoors. This jacket is not intended to be your rain shedder, but it does well in a light rain in my experience and won't soak through. The velcro cuffs are nice to have and don't make the ends of the sleeves feel overly stiff. I find I only end up needing to use the hood about 25% of the time when I am wearing this jacket, so I really appreciate the unobtrusiveness of this light and stretchy hood. 

How I use it: I often use this jacket for some weather protection when its cool outside (45- 65) and I may want a hood handy. I reach for it when walking around town, walking my dog, or when on shorter bike rides (<10mi).

What I wouldn't use it for: When it gets colder (upper 20- 40's) I reach for my Marmot Prodigy or Arc'teryx Gamma MX. If you are looking for something for rainy days or that is windproof, the Tempo isn't what you are looking for. I also wear this over a sweater or light fleece for a little added weather protection.

Well, I can confirm that it seems like a very warm, well-made bag, but it is way too big for someone my size (5'6"", 130lbs). Certainly, the amount of room I had would have caused me to be colder than I would in a well-fitting bag.

Size: I'm 5ft6in, and 130lbs. I originally bought the bag in the long version, but then exchanged it for the regular. Much better for me, the feet are actually in the foot box. It is a little tight around the shoulders IF you wanted to stretch. I tend to stay compact so it was perfect.

TEMPERATURE: Very cozy and warm.  I spent 1 week in the Shenandoahs and the temperatures were close to 0Celsius (32F) at night. I was eager to get into the bag at night. I still had my first layer on and I was very cozy and slept well. The oustide was a little humid in the morning, but dried quickly and actually never made it to the inside anyways.

1. The stuff sack it comes with is useless. Buy a real compression sack because the bag has a mind of its own and really prefers to take up as much space as it can. I tried putting it in the flimsy little stuff sack it came with and within thirty seconds it had popped out and was spread out across my floor. 
2. I do NOT fit in the regular bag. I'm 5'10 and 160 pounds, pretty slim guy, most of the weight is scrawny muscle. But I am too long for the bag. If I push my feet hard against the bottom of the bag, my girlfriend can work the hood over my head, but I feel like super trapped. It's also nearly skin tight around my thighs. I can't spread my legs more than a couple inches. I get the phrase mummy bag means something, but this is one heck of a tight bag (or maybe I'm just claustrophobic).

The only complaint I have regarding this sleeping bag is the size of the stuff sack.  It's very long.  Too long for my pack.  If you are going to use this bag on backpacking trips, I would recommend that you invest in a compression sack to make it easier to fit in your pack.  
The bag is super light, which makes it easy for backpackers.  When you take it out of your stuff sack, it takes maybe 10 minutes to ""fluff"" to its normal size.

The material was soft and light. It was long enough so it covered what I needed it to and the purple wasn't see through. I have a long torso so this is one of my top concerns with any shirt. I was quite happy with my shirt and went in search of more just like it. Backcountry was having a sale on them - hooray!
I ordered a small ice heather (since it was the only size available and I was on the line between medium and small for chest measurements) as well as medium gem green heather and kinetic pink heather. When they arrived I tried them each on and was disappointed!
The small was significantly smaller, shorter and not even really a heather just a flat color clearly showing my bra line all over the place. The green I almost kept. The color was pretty, not see through and a good fit, BUT it was not the same length as the other mediums! Every inch counts when you have a long torso and it was a little too short if I was bending over. See the picture. The pink was long enough, a pretty color BUT it showed my bra. Not just my bra outline, the color and entire bra was very discernible especially on the back. Why wear a shirt if I can see right through it? I had high hopes for at least one of these being as good as the purple. I would give them two stars but I like the purple one I have and if you have a shorter torso the green would be fine.

I was worried they wouldn't be warm enough. That disappointment immediately disappeared when I tried them on. The interior fabric is really soft, to the point that I want to sleep, work, and play in these pants all day every day. That's not even an exaggeration. If I could, I would. I followed the size chart. I wear size 4 in most pants, but my measurements were closer to the 6. They almost have a perfect fit. The hip and waist is just right for me (I have a 32"" hip size and 29"" waist size) They're a tad too long on me (my inseam is 29""), but I like to roll them up and show off the flannel design underneath anyway, so I'm glad they're long. The crotch, butt, and leg flare are a bit baggy; I'd compare them to boyfriend jeans. I definitely don't have a flat butt, so if you have no butt, these might end up looking like men's pants on you. I actually prefer this bagginess because it allows for baselayers underneath, and it allows for better movement during exertion (hiking, snowshoeing, and biking for me). I wore them recently during a typical PNW downpour, and although the thighs of the outer material got wet, you could easily wipe most of the drips away with your hand, and I never felt the water soak through. If it did, I stayed warm and didn't notice. I certainly would have added rain pants over the top if I had planned to stay out in the rain for a while, but my point is, the DWR finish works really well. The material lining the belt region feels very soft against the skin.  The pockets are roomy, though I do wish they zipped closed. And lastly, they are warm! I run very cold, but in 30°-40°F I don't wear baselayers and these are adequate. 20s-30°sF I wear baselayers and stay very warm as long as I keep moving. I plan to wear these as my winter backpacking/snowshoeing pants with gaiters and with or without baselayers, depending on the temps, weather, and my level of exertion. Well done, Marmot.

"Marmot","Freerider Jacket - Men's","1154834",2,"This is a really nice jacket.  It feels good and has great features. Lots of good pockets, a nice size hood, and a good powder skirt. 

The downsides is the review video from marmot said it has mesh under the pit vents but it does not. No wrist gaiters (although I knew this).  

The big problem for me is the sleeves are ridiculously short.  It is basically impossible to keep coverage over the gloves so I am guessing keeping snow out would be impossible.  But the rest of the jacket fits great and allows for the layers I would want. So upping the size doesn't seem like it would really work for me.

If the fit is right it would be good. But just doesn't fit the bill.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-11-08 00:00:00","I returned this product before using it",""

Thought I would step it up with the speed light because of the potential for heavy rain, and oh boy that was a mistake! The first good rain I had, the pockets filled with water (not a little water, but like FULL of water) I thought it might be a fluke, so I dried they out. The next rain I had, I made sure the pockets were zipped perfectly, with the zipper tucked under the little hood. no go. still didn't work. Very disappointing to have this piece of gear not work as advertized on the other side of the globe. It rains a lot in new Zealand, and i expected more form marmot (i have loved all my other marmot products). If it was to rain more than .5 cm the pockets would just FILL with water, what a weird flaw. So far I have worn the jacket a total of 60 times, and in 35 rain storms. About 15 of those rainstorms have been sprinkles, and the other 20 I got water in the pockets. One storm I must have had close to 200ml of water in each side. What didn't make since to me is that the waterproof zipper kept water in but not out... typically I don't write reviews this quickly, but I figured it would be worth while because of this failure.

No cold hands, ever, even in sub-zero conditions.  Never use warmers, but will throw a thin glove liner on in worst conditions.  Proper core/head/neck layering is essential.  Gloves/mitts can't correct a cold core or head, but one can get by with a thinner glove/mitt with proper, sufficient layering.  Managed to get snow in my gloves, accidentally -  they dried out in an hour or two while wearing them.  Expecting same from these.

Would have gone back to Radonnee, but got a really good Cyber-Monday deal on Ultimate.

First impressions: Fits perfect, design appears to be same as my old Radonnee - with leather added.  Gauntlet is same length.  Have 20 year old, well worn work gloves of similar weight leather, no holes/tears - will be disappointed if I  have Blake D's experience.

Ordered  Marmot Warmest Mitts for my wife.  Thought they would run small, ordered L.  Turns out, for my wife, mitt size doesn't run small.  Backcountry was great to work with.  Having M pair sent - will check, side by side, returning pair that doesn't fit  for full refund (don't cut tags off!).

Used REI in the past for Marmot gear, and REI was great to work with.  First Radonnee set let go on a seam after a year.  REI replaced them, no charge - clearly a manufacturing defect.  The replacement pair lasted 10 years.  Would have gone back to REI, but they didn't have the model/size in stock.  And the Backcountry Cyber-Monday deal was impossible to ignore.  

Heading west with these.  May throw the old Radonnee in as well - they're kind of like old dogs, even sporting a bit of gray.  As long as they can have a quality life, hate to put 'em down.

My extremities ski a bit cold, so I was looking for a tough cold weather glove, and they're great at most temperatures, but lacking in the true cold (although they even breathe pretty well and my hands haven't sweat that much on bluebird days when I should probably be skiing with a lighter glove).  Skiing in really cold weather, most recently Jackson, the wind seems to flow straight through these gloves and my hands freeze.  This has only been a problem in very cold weather (<15 F), they work great in moderately cold weather.

"Marmot","Ultimate Ski Glove","105820886",3,"For the suggested retail price, these are far from ultimate.   I have gloves from Black Diamond (Guide)and Hestra (Heli) and the Marmot’s  fall short in major areas that I consider necessary to boast as being the ultimate ski glove.
The gauntlet is a bit short compared to the Heli, has a smaller diameter opening and is too soft to my liking.  I find that a shorter, small, soft gauntlet is hard to get over bulky layers especially when you have one glove on and must work the other gauntlet down using your now glove-fattened fingers of the opposite hand.  A soft gauntlet collapses more easily down to the wrist eventually bunching up during the day.  The gauntlets on the BD’s and Hestra’s slip over bulky layers without much coaxing, the Heli goes up farther on the forearm and both remain in place without collapsing down to the wrist.   
The liner is not removable so they cannot be dismantled to enhance drying overnight in preparation for the next day.   I have purchased winter work-type gloves from other retailers and side by side the $175 Marmot’s look more like $70-$90 winter gloves. In contrast,  you can see and feel the difference in the BD’s or Hestra’s.
I’ve been doing this outdoor thing for many years and am confident the glove is going to be about as warm as most gloves of this general class and weight of insulation.

As someone who is referred to as the ""jacket whore"" in my family I feel like I appreciate a good jacket
I got this on sale over a year ago and have loved it.  Very light jacket but with the normal pockets it doesn't feel like you're compromising function for weight.  
I ordered a medium and it fit is snug but doesn't inhibit motion at all,  I wanted it for a layer.  
Has maybe lost 3 feathers while I've had it.  Doesn't lose down and unlike a couple other jackets I've had even with weeks of use with sometimes dirty oily clothes the down is still completely lofted.   
Great looking jacket with a more tailored athletic cut.  Also the right amount of fill I hate jackets that seem like they skimped on the down and the baffles are collapsing.
The fabric is definitely fragile like most lightweight nylons but surprisingly durable.  Not as heavy of a weight as the fabric on the comparable TNF jackets but definitely heavier than the fabric on the MH ghost whisperer.  A perfect balance I think.

The stretch used to be in the long direction, which allowed for knee and leg flexibility without stretching out.

I'm kind of short and stout, so I went for the large, thinking I'd need the room in the thighs through the waist.  Holy cow are these some long pants! The fit was pretty good, but the length was obnoxious, my pretty slender 6 ft. tall BF tried them on and they were perfect lengthwise for him (not so much for me being 5'5'').

She uses these while both teaching skiing and snowboarding and the fit is perfect for either activity. The suspenders are removable which is also a nice plus if they start bothering you. 

The sizing on these pants seems to run a bit tight in the legs so sizing up is generally a good call, if the run a bit too long on your legs then you can always cuff the pants to accommodate for any extra length.","EMPLOYEE","2017-01-30 00:00:00","I've used it several times","true"

They fit my waist, but were thighs in my thighs (although I wouldn't consider my legs strong/big...) 

They were also short, although I do have long lets, so I've had this problem.

The real bummer was that on my first use my ski sliced a 1-inch gash on the left leg when I slid and fell on an especially steep part of the mountain.

Prior getting them, I was already planning to buy them myself since it was on sale and I needed a pair of super waterproof pants (and my 15k Ride pants had duct tape on them).  I read reviews and was a tad bit hesitant to follow through with the purchase due to folks having wedgies, but...  after wearing this for a good 4-6 snow days already - I absolutely LOVE them.  Yes, I get minor wedgies but a little adjustment of the suspender should fix it.  The pants fit well, are not too long, and are super super nice.  I definitely recommend these.  I've gotten compliments and inquiries from older generation skiiers about the pants and I always say they are worth every penny.

My only complaint is that the connecting zipper from the bib to the pant is pretty difficult to put back together after dropping the seat. It's really tiny and hard to zip back up with cold hands!

"Marmot","Spire Pant - Women's","106380187",5,"I was torn between buying a pair of Patagonia Powslayers and the Spire for a few weeks, and it was really tough choosing between the two, but I love, love the Spire so far! For the price, I really haven't found a huge difference between them and the Powslayers. I haven't tested the durability much yet but I'm impressed with how solid the fabric feels, and the Green Garnet color is even more vivid than in the pictures. For me, the Spire has a much more tailored fit than the Powslayer did, especially through the waist and butt. They also run on the shorter side, which works really well for me but may not for taller girls. I understand where some of the other reviewers were coming from in regards to the ""weird"" fit through the butt/hips, but I found when I loosened the straps enough, I had plenty of room to move around, sidestep, hike, etc. in these. I think it's  probably something that depends pretty heavily on how you like your pants to fit --these will be on the slimmer, but not tight, side--and your body shape. If you want something baggier, the Powslayer is probably a better choice, or you could just size up in these. I've already taken advantage of the full-zip sides during a warm weekend, and I've found the pants to be pretty breathable and light, but not flimsy. I've only skied resorts in them, so I can't speak to their performance in the backcountry, but I'd imagine they'd do well. Looking forward to using these for the next few seasons!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-02-29 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
