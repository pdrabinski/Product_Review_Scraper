Note: I gave it 4-Stars, because we haven't used it extensively and haven't used it for ski touring or mountaineering. 

Here is what he liked:

1) Fit! This is the fist climbing/backpacking pack under 80 Liters, that he has found comfortable to wear. He found it very comfortable on the hip bones, and liked the weight distribution. He carries about 35 lbs of climbing gear. We usually take two ropes to guide friends.

2) Simplicity! He wants to stuff everything in, and dump everything out. This has a big wide interior and opening, which makes it really easy to get stuff in and out of. There are a pockets in the brain, for organization, and will take a Hydration Bladder.

3) Tough Crampon and Helmet pocket. The external pocket is big and durable, so you don't have to wince, every time you put your gear in there.

4) Look. He likes the design and colors. Hey, that's important too!

Here's a picture of my using it as a day pack, without the top pocket, or brain. I also find it very comfortable, without  any pain on the hips bones.

"The North Face","Cobra 52L Backpack","101569590",5,"My favorite part about this pack is the simplicity thats combined with some serious durability that doesn't weigh me down. The main compartment easily stores my sleeping bag, cookware, clothes, and food for 3-5 days and the lid is large enough for all the quick essentials including my camera. With some purchased accessory straps my tent and sleeping bag are easily attached to the outside of the back in the traditional horizontal fashion.  While these straps don't break the bank, it would have been nice as an included feature. 

Previously, I've exclusively used packs with a suspension system like Deuter or Osprey, and have been blown away with the long term comfort this pack has provided. Without a crazy amount of padding on the back or waist belt the pack doesn't have the initial cloud-like comfort you get from putting on one of the more padded suspension packs. However, as my trips progress the simplicity comes into play and I tend to ""forget"" the pack is there or causing any higher pressure points.

"The North Face","ThermoBall Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","2456887",4,"This is my second thermoball jacket. I lost a lot of weight and needed to size down, and found this on sale for a total steal.  There are a lot of reasons to get this jacket, but know what you get:

PROS:
-This jacket breathes better than my Arcteryx Atom LT and my Patagonia Nano Air. Seriously.
-Fit... The fit just works for me. But it IS a little boxier than most technical jackets. This works for me, I have huge shoulders.
- Best mimic of a down jacket I have ever used.
- Warm. I used to wear two layers while working outside in Utah winter's. Now, this jacket does the trick 80% of the time alone..
-Fabric- this fabric is very durable compared to many puffy's. I have had countless times when I rubbed up next to something and was surprised there was no hole. Awesome nylon. Not a magical nylon... Just not a cheap nylon. Also, this jacket feels better against my skin than all my other jackets.

CONS:

-hood is pretty large and not adjustable. Compared to Arcteryx, this hood is barely functional but I do use it, and it is at least warm.
Longevity - I still have my old thermoball that is now over 4 years  old. It has lost some of its loft and warmth. Still works, but it's not actually down. Should not be surprising to you. The nylon she'll is still in great shape. I have washed and dried this jacket several times in my washer and dryer with no issues.

I hope they make more jackets in this color as  I get a lot of compliments and it is very hard to find.  It has two large zipped pockets.  With only a waffle henley or an office long sleeve shirt and as long that it's not windy, it keeps me decently warm when the NYC temps is in the 40s (wet or dry weather).  It is also not bulky to wear and appears to hold up on almost daily city use.

My gripes with North Face jackets is that they should make single Napoleon pocket and two-way zip standard on all jackets.  

As for the fit vs my body type, due to being a regular in the weight room over the years, I am in that category where not only am I transitioning from a medium to a large, the large size fits me all over well except for the length of the jacket.  Lately, I tend to have fitting issues in the upper-arm, armpit diameter, shoulder, chest/lats areas.

I'm glad I listened to the fine folks of the internet because I scored big time with this purchase. 

The jacket runs true to size (perfect arm length), his good shoulder dexterity, a decent lining that breathes, and most importantly: is durable. I wore this thing through a winter in the high desert and it was ideal. I've had no issues with abrasion climbing on rocks or moving under load on shorter hikes. 

Obviously not a good choice for long distance movement as it is heavy and doesn't pack well, and probably not the best for hardcore alpine ascents in wet/ below freezing conditions, but for short, semi-technical movements, it's perfect. 

After 6 months of use, I can say it is no worse for wear. Use some Nickwax and it retains a decent amount of water resistance. Not a huge fan of the sleeve cuff velcro fasteners, but they work well enough in warm weather. I'm assuming it was considered in the design of the jacket, so no points off. 

Overall - 
*4/5 as an all around  jacket
* 5/5 for serious outdoor enthusiasts who need a durable wind-stopper for short term pursuits. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-08 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

This jacket works over a tshirt on chilly days, but when temps drop into the 30s I have to layer properly.  It is thin so it isn't a great stand alone jacket in Winter.

It's a technical piece. I've worn it on Winter backpacking trips where evening temps hit freezing. On the trail in 38 degrees I have worn it directly over a thin baselayer and had to half unzip it to keep from overheating. 32 degrees in camp with a fleece midlayer underneath left me just warm enough to not be cold. Had conditions worsened I'd have gotten cold. The jacket does block some wind, but not all of it.

I considered going with down this time around, but decided against it. Our Southern Winters are very wet so synthetic insulation seemed the better choice. I looked into the performance of different synthetic insulations and thermoball is among the very best. Just keep in mind that there isn't a lot of it in this jacket.

These jackets are cut a little better than a lot of competing designs and so look sharp. When layering I can comfortably wear midweight base and 150 weight fleece quarterzips. My heavyweight full zip fleece is a bit bulky under this jacket, but thats just me.

As far as sizing goes these jackets seem to run large. I actually measured myself and picked my size based on the size chart. The jacket seems true to size based on the size chart. In most jackets (and all tshirts) I wear an extra large, but in this one a large is perfect. 

I rate this jacket a 4. My only wish is that it had another ounce or two of insulation. Too much would mess it up for what it is, but I think a little more would help.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-08-19 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

His birthday is in May, but by then he really won't be wearing too much fleece, so I gave it to him early.

IF you're Inside or wear it underneath a shell/coat.
Otherwise, wind literally passes Right THROUGH the fleece so you'll literally FREEZE on cold, WINDY days/nights. 
Pay attention and notice how many people wear a sweatshirt underneath as that'll help block the wind but not by much.
The nylon covered areas will block some of the wind but you'll definitely feel it throughout the body.
Best to NOT wear it as a main jacket but underneath another.
Also, wear it when it's relatively cool but NOT cold as it doesn't insulate that well.
It's roomy throughout and true to size but use a fleece DWR to help keep fleece water resistant. Use it underneath a jacket for warmth but not by itself.
Almost ALL TNF fleece sucks as they're NOT wind Proof or even Resistant unless it specifically says so (i.e. soft shell or Windblock type material).
Save money and buy a Non TNF fleece unless you want to be fashionable as TNF is more of a fashion brand nowadays.

""I received a North Face Thermoball vest last week and I have found the garment to be extremely light weight and well constructed. After owning several Spyder thermal vests, The North Face vest is lighter in weight and better in warmth. It is so light, it does not feel as you are wearing it.

My daughter had given me the TNF Red with the black logo and zipper and it coordinates well with the gray and black color winter garments I wear, including The North Face thermal pants. It contains a high quality zipper that functions smoothly regardless the temperature.

I really am impressed with the durability of the Thermoball nylon and fabric. I have a North Face black Thermoball Full-Zip Jacket I have owned for a year and have been very pleased with it's weight, texture and dark color. It still looks as good as the day I first wore it.

The Thermoball material beads moisture and the quilted pattern has a futuristic look and feel. I have received numerous compliments on the Thermoball vest occasion I wear it""

Extra insulation, stand alone jacket

Pros:
Did help keep me warmer in the dead of winter than my jacket alone. Very lightweight.

Cons:
Not slimmer fit.

Wished it was a little thicker, might help against wind when using as standalone.

Too early to tell about how it will hold up, but so far so good.  Only reason not 4 stars is the hipstrap buckles could have been better designed.

"The North Face","Straight Paramount 3.0 Convertible Pant - Men's","107803439",4,"FIT:
Most similar pants on the market seem to be excessively baggy. Not these. The Straight Paramount 3.0 are slim (but not tight) and taper nicely leaving enough room to freely move. I really like the fit of the pant. They do run a little small as the 'Regular' inseam is only 31"" and the shorts are a measly 8"". I originally purchased the 'Regular' but exchanged them for a 'Long' (33"" inseam). Unfortunately the shorts remain 8"" for all sizes, which sits several inches above the knee. While this is fine for hiking/swimming, it makes them too short to wear for any casual use. At least for my taste.

QUALITY:
As with most TFN products, the quality is excellent. Lightweight, quick-drying material keep you comfortable after a long day on the trail. Although the material is thin, they have proven to be durable so far. The material stretches and I really like the lightweight, built-in belt (which can be removed and/or replaced with a belt of your choice). The cargo pocket is well designed. So is the zippered system to convert your pants.

USE:
I highly recommend these pants for 3-season hiking/backpacking/camping. The convertible feature of the Straight Paramount 3.0 allow you to save weight in your pack as these could be the only outer bottoms you take. The mesh pockets and quick-drying material make the shorts perfect for swimming so you can lose the extra trunks as well. I wish the rear pockets had some sort of closure (velcro/button/zipper) just to help secure wallet or other items.

CONCLUSION:
Overall, these pants are well-built and practically designed for your outdoor endeavors. I would definitely recommend the Straight Paramount 3.0 to other customers in the market for a great fitting, quality, convertible pant. Just be aware of the inseam lengths and you won't be disappointed.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-05-21 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"The North Face","Straight Paramount 3.0 Convertible Pant - Men's","3423347",5,"Great convertible pants.  Fabric is very durable but comfortable.  Not much ""crinkle"" when walking.  The best thing is the fit of the pants.  Every other convertible model I tried were huge in the legs.  These pants have a nice slim fit to them but nothing like skinny jeans.  Just a modern tailored fit.  And the shorts zipped to a nice length as well.  A few inches above the knee and kept their tailored appearance.  Additionally the zippers around the legs are integrated nicely into the design so they don't show the distinct convertible ""lines"" at the half way point.  When zipped they nearly appear to be regular pants.  Side zip pocket is angled for easy access to a phone or wallet without bulging like cargo pockets.  The integrated belt can be removed if you are so inclined to wear another belt of your choosing.  Front pockets are very deep and roomy.  Wish one of the back pockets had a zipper closure but that is not the case.  I was able to put my passport, phone and small wallet in the side zipper pocket with relative comfort and security for travel.  After looking at almost every convertible design available, I would say that TNF really nailed the design and aesthetic.  Great travel or adventure pants that can also be dressed up if needed.  A sink wash and hang dry and you are good to go for bringing these as your only pants for a trip.  Highly recommended!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-03-27 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

It has been a couple of weeks, but feathers / downs have started coming out at a few places. I had bought a Down jacket from Old Navy for $20 on a deal which I dumped because of this downs coming out issue. When I spoke to a Backcountry Gearhead, he mentioned that this is not uncommon in Down Jackets & I shouldn't be too worried, so I'll give a benefit of doubt to North face here.
I live in Southern California where the low temperatures are between 50 - 60 degrees these days, but I don't feel sufficiently warm after wearing this jacket.
 I don't know how down jackets from other branded manufacturers (Marmot, Columbia etc..) are, but I expect better warmth if I pay $120 for a Jacket.

I generally wear a size Small, but I bought this in Medium because TNF is known for a more tailored fit. The overall look of this Apex Bionic 2 is very nice. The fabric has a nice finish and the style is just above casual (depending on what you wear it with). The raglan sleeves lend to greater mobility in the arms, which is what I wanted for winter hiking and snowshoeing. It does bag a bit on me, and the collar is big. These details are fine, though, because I will be wearing a neck gaiter, base, and mid layers when it gets colder outside. I was able to zip this jacket all the way up without choking or suffering from a zipper pileup when I tried it on with an Icebreaker hoodie. I will say that the jacket with my mid layer hoodie was not comfortable in the collar until I put the hood on (for what that's worth). So, the collar is large, but not gigantic. The sizing also felt fine over wearing my midlayer and base layer together. I still had flexibility and the jacket did not feel snug. Tonight I wore it outside over an Ibex Woolies base layer and felt fine. Just a skosh cold initially, but fine. I dislike cold wind, so my main focus was to mitigate that. Then it's all about the layering. A final thing I will mention is that the jacket length in back comes down over most of my butt. That means I won't get a chill or need to re-tuck everything if I need to bend down to check my snow gaiters or tie my boots or whatever. That is a plus in my book.

"The North Face","Dryzzle Hooded Jacket - Men's","107441931",3,"Bought this jacket back February, and since then it's been on rainy backpacking trips, and between my car and office.

Pros:  
The fit is long enough to cover my torso and waist line, and the slight dip in the back helps the rain waiter drain off my back instead of down the back of my legs. 
The fabric makes it light, packable, and not loud/crunchy.

Cons:
Gore-Tex Paclite 2L fabric.  If you've never tried Paclite fabric before, please please please do so before you ever buy a product made with it.  This is not your standard bomb-proof Gore-Tex experience you might be expecting, and that's because they removed a critical third layer in the Paclite line.  The 2 layer system, simply stated, means that it will block rain, but not condensation.  
I suspect that the reviewer below that called this ""not waterproof"" had this experience.  After some time in the rain, condensation will build up on the inside of the jacket, causing you to feel like the rain went right through it.  I can go into why that happens for anyone curious, (just ask).

Summary: The jacket is cut well and works perfectly CONSIDERING the fabric choice.  I would not ever recommend this jacket for a rainy weekend adventure outdoors.  Use this for urban environments where you're not exposed to downpour rain longer than 15-30 minutes, and it will work flawlessly.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-10-07 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"The North Face","Gotham Hooded Down Jacket III - Men's","110456065",3,"It's a pretty nice jacket, but there are a few small things that bother me about it and affect the conditions I'd wear it in. 1) the fur hood attached via buttons. Fine, but this allows wind to get through the flap holes which is a huge deal if you anticipate using this as winter coat. 2) the pockets for hands are not that large and are just lightly fleece lined. My hands get cold easily, so this is another big problem for cold conditions. 
That's about it as far as the make or break features for me. Just know that it is 550 goose down so while it's warm, it's not all that warm, especially for it's large size. This makes it a cool weather jacket more than a winter coat, but it is too puffy for a cool weather jacket. I just don't think it serves a purpose on my wardrobe since I can't use it as a winter coat and it's a little large for a cool weather / mild winter coat.

A medium shirt (most often bought by me) has the potential to fit perfect throughout the torso and be too tight in the shoulders (insert the joke about wearing little brothers shirt). A large usually fits perfect in the shoulders but is too baggy and/or long in the torso. Having said all of that I gambled and purchased a medium despite the fact that it has an athletic fit.

Since I was about to check out with the regular version and saw on the bottom of the screen the ""hooded"" version; I assumed the hooded was the same as the regular; only with a hood added. Silly me.   2) the pockets have a vented liner in them.  This is almost the same as leaving bare hands out in the cold if it's truly cold & windy outside (when else would I use the wind Stopper?  I'm all ears)  because the material sags with the weight of your hands.  I'd like to see a cold weather jacket pocket lined by the coats material - not cheaper vent with large holes.  Even the material used on the Denali pockets would be better.  Also, keys get caught in it.  3)The chest on the large is great for me(43) but the arms are for a gorilla (they're long).

Can tell right away that it blocks wind in blowing weather. Does fine in light rain as water beads, but I think it would leak through an extended and hard rain.  Not meant to  be waterproof, so might need hard shell over. Also, seems good down to about 25-30 degrees depending on base layers.  Surprisingly warm for weight.

Good for active use with ""stretchy"" material. Relaxed fit allows for layering.  Only down side is the cut of the  sleeves.  They are cut very tight and I have a difficult time getting the jacket on with anything but short sleeves or a thin base layer. The fleece in the sleeves seems to grab whatever you have on your arms since they are so tight. Only reason I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5. Have asked another owner when I saw him wearing in a store and he said he has the same problem. He also loved jacket otherwise. So, difficult to layer over anything bulky in the sleeves.  Bought the hooded version as keeps my head and neck dry and warm with cold or rain. Easy to flip up, but wish it stowed to keep out of the way. It does not. Cinching the hood allows close fit with my head and face and does a good job turning with my head. So, does well in allowing unobstructed view, pet peeve of mine with other jackets. 

Side pockets have meshy material inside so opening pockets allows for venting when getting warm. No pit zips. The upper chest pocket has small hole that allows you to snake your head phones cable inside your jacket from the IPod or MP3 player in that pocket up to your ears. . Guide loop inside.

Bought the hoodless version for my daughters and liked the style and quality so bought the hooded one for me. Thought the hood was definitely worth the extra $20 at regular price.

A bit pricey at MSRP of $170 but caught on sale for $110 so was a snag. Suspect I will love for long while to come. Cheers.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-03-14 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"The North Face","McMurdo Hooded Down Parka III - Men's","108672463",5,"I received this as a ""gift"" from my wife - I picked it out myself :-).  

Pros: WARM. Have worn it in NY weather this winter (temps in the teens in F) and was surprised at how warm it was.  I only had a long sleeved t-shirt and this coat, and was out in the snow without feeling anything.  I was almost sweating, but that may have been a result of the outdoor activity rather than the coat.  
STYLISH. I also bought the Gotham II, which I also liked but for different reasons.  This one is longer, and looks a bit more refined.  Also, you get the warmth without looking like a ""Michelin man"".  I have even worn it over my suit for work, instead of the traditional wool overcoat, when the temps were in the single digits.
OTHER. Face mask built in, waterproof, down, detachable hood/trim, multiple exterior pockets

Cons: Yes, the sleeves aren't ribbed, coming instead with velcro - which makes them less snug - but that can be adjusted relatively easily.  I also found the zipper was a bit clumsy to use - because it is a double-zipper system which doesn't begin at the bottom of the coat (which extends about six inches lower than the bottom of the zipper).  That is probably my biggest gripe, though I have to say the extra length adds to the more stylish look on this coat.

Sizing - I thought the jacket ran a bit large.  I am usually between L and XL in many stores (XL usually, particularly if the cut is slimmer). The XL was way too big for me here.  The L fits perfectly.  Backcountry customer service was simply awesome in helping me sort through my questions to get the right one.

*Pros*

* It's a big jacket, but when the temperature drops you will want to wear this jacket, that's for sure.
* I tested it in NYC with temperatures lower than 20 F and I was always warm and toasty without any base layer. So I guess you can layer it for lower temperatures.
* The pockets are large and convenient. 
* The Jacket brings an internal face-mask attached to the hood, this makes it perfect for cold wind.

* There is just one inner pocket. It would be great to have at least 2.

"The North Face","Warm Tight - Women's","107515141",5,"I am so in love with these as a base layer, I'm not even sure where to start. I did a lot of research before settling on these to replace my (incredibly old, heavy and outdated) base layer that I've been relying on for the past decade or so.

For starters, one of my biggest issues with base layers is my athletic build – most of them just don't fit right, which results in either loose fabric where there shouldn't be any, or I am constantly having to pull my pants up because they keep slipping down. I just don't have that problem with these. I'm sure I annoyed my boyfriend because I was so excited about not having to constantly adjust my base layer. (Seriously, constantly adjusting on the trail is annoying and I will be singing the praises of these pants for that reason alone for a long time to come.)

They are incredibly soft and comfortable. And I love the thickness, a lot of base layers can feel really bulky underneath pants, but these are the perfect thickness for wearing by themselves or under another layer.

I run pretty cold, so while these are meant more as a snowboarding/skiing base layer – I actually use them on all of my backpacking trips, and I've been incredibly happy with the amount of warmth they have provided.

I have had it for a week now and noticed there was a small hole in the front of the jacket in the stomach area. I came on here right away and chatted again with another online consultant.

So they accommodated me AGAIN and sent it 2-day shipping AND said I didn't have to return it until the other coat gets here. All they would have to do is charge my credit card and when they get my damaged coat back, they would refund the money. Works for me!!

This is a great feature to have when putting a backpack to go to class and for getting in and out of the car, or taking it off in more cramped spaces, like the inside of a bar.

I do wish the chest pocket was larger. It is barely large enough for my phone (iphone 5s), so can't imagine what some of the larger phones fit like. Since it works for me and my needs, I didn't knock down any stars.

Only criticism would be sleeve pocket (for lift pass)and this would be a 6 star jacket. Fabric is flexible and moves with you, the brushed lining does add warmth. Its extremely windproof and repels moisture (snow and rain) well. Will be interested to know how long this lasts. Hood works well with helmet (smith Vantage) and when fully zippered on windy/powder days plenty of room around the face, velcro sleeve tabs provide options whether wearing cuff or gauntlet gloves...

"The North Face","Terra 50L Backpack","106409864",4,"Ill admit I have not yet taken this for the real test. BUT.. In looking for a 50L pack I tried on a bunch of them at various stores including: Thule capstone 50; Osprey Kestral 48; Deuter 50+15; REI Flash 45 and 62; and probably others.

I expect to be using this on some long hikes and on some walk in camping where Ill stay several days. I was looking at 50 L packs sizes since my sleeping pad is a thermarest-z.. which will ride on my pack rather than in my pack, leaving me enough room for everything else I need at 50L. 

The potential exists for me to be carrying quite a load however.
I wanted the pack to be able to handle 35+ lbs. For each pack I tried on in the stores I used their weighted pillows to test out each pack. My tests were all specific to me but included: how well it felt handling that weight for a walk around the store; if it felt stable when I twisted from side to side; if it stayed in place when I bent down to tie my shoes or reach something on the ground; if it felt balanced while standing straight up.

Nothing I could try on in the store quite fit correctly, nor was passing each test to my satisfaction with that much weight. I could see on line a couple of contenders but searched in vain to locate them in a store. Particularly this one. North Face Terra 50. I found a Terra 65 in a store to check how well it fit - and it was good but not the right size for what I wanted.

Of the  packs I tried on in the stores the Thule capstone 50 was the best at handling the load and twisting and bending down tests. It was snug and had the mesh back and easy side and bottom access..I really wanted to get it but.. when standing up straight it touched the back of my neck and actually made my posture a bit off if I tried standing up straight. No matter what setting or straps I adjusted could make it feel right. It just didnt fit me up there. My torso is right at 20.5.

I was reluctant to get something online because I hate the idea of having to do returns. I chatted with the customer service persons online at Backcountry to make sure there would be no problems if I wanted to make a return and asked a ton of specific details about the pack that were unclear from online info [this one does not have adjustable torso length, but the Terra 65 does, the waist sizes in the tables from Northface are incorrect for the Terra 50].  I settled on trying the North Face 50 and had it shipped. Shipping and customer service have been great. 

The Terra 50 fits me just right, has several adjustments that can be used while moving to loosen up the load on your shoulders, but the load stays balanced correctly on my hips. at home I weighed it down with regular camping stuff, extra liters of water and my cast iron griddle.

This pack handles the load excellently. As good or better than any of the other 50 L packs I tried in the stores. The balance was very good and tying my shoes was not any different than most of the other packs I tried. 

I am looking forward to taking it out very soon, and can give more info then. It did not cradle my back and hold on as stable while bending over and moving as the Thule Capstone 50 which performed best in almost all of my categories - - the Thule just did not fit me right when standing up straight, and the other packs could really not handle the load I wanted. 

If you are in the market for a 50 L I would highly suggest trying them on in the stores, but consider this pack and consider Backcountry if you need to try on something you can't find, or if nothing seems to fit just right. Finally - this was the cheapest pack I tried by almost 50$. For backpacks - like shoes - find something that fits you. - very happy with this purchase and my experience with Backcountry . Cheers

I weigh 160lbs and managed to keep my pack weight around 30lbs. The sleeping bag pouch in the bottom fits an average size bag, but would be ideal with a slightly smaller mummy style bag. You can expect a tight squeeze if your bag is too big. It will also ride up into the upper compartment as it adjusts which may be a con or pro, but I still had plenty of room. The soulder to hip adjuster is a new feature on this model and I found it to work very well. 

The biggest pro I can think of was the overall convenience of pocket placement. The handy waist pockets were almost too easy to reach snackfood and anything else I put in there.�One con I could percieve being a problem for others might be the difficulty of tying any extra gear on to either the bottom or top. I would just say it's time to modernize. Most tents, stoves, sleeping bags, and anything else you need these days are small and comapactable enough to fit in 65 Liters.� I would feel comfortable taking this on a 4-5 day hiking trip.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-07-22 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""
"The North Face","Terra 65L Backpack","5368418",5,"The North Face makes spacious backpacks with full body support. The back and hip supports are unbeatable for the price, and I think the style is awesome as well.

The design, at least in last years version of the Terra 65, made finding gear easy. There are zippers everywhere and The North Face never skimps on sturdy materials for those long hikes in the backcountry.

Mine has lasted well into this year and its over a year old with TONS of use. I use it for rope and quick-draws for days at the crag and long hikes as well. I used it for part of the Colorado Trail during winter which was hardcore, and the bag was wonderful.

I have also strapped skis to this bad boy and it fared VERY well.

All in all, this is a great larger sized pack.

Its definitely versatile!

Get yourself one for sure! The price is right and The North Face and backcountry.com back their products. Thus, you've got nothing to lose checking this bag out.

Pros
-Sturdy, it still  looks brand new
-Looks like an actual base camp duffel (just mini)
-has a hook for hanging
-mirror (pretty cheap and dinky, but i'll use it until it dies, then i can make my own, its just velcro)
-its a good size holds a lot. (all the toiletries i own, even when not traveling can fit in here)
-the molle/daisy chain attachments are great for attaching outside your pack/bag 

Cons
-it is still really stiff
-despite the fact that it is really stiff, it still seems to cave in, which in my opinion, its gotta be one or the other (soft or stiff and hold its shape)
-when i travel, i have extra space in the bag that doesn't compress, and thus takes up space in my bag.
-the organization is minimal
-there are no end pockets in this model. the older model does. you can ID the older model by the buckle instead of hook for hanging)

A major plus is that the hood isn't ridiculously large!  I returned my last jacket because the hood came down to my chin!

I put the jacket on and was very happy with the fit. I am tall and skinny, and this jacket is the right size and length for my body type. I did use the front pocket pull strings to tighten the lower half of the jacket up, because it was letting in too much cold air.

In all of these conditions, including wind, this jacket excels. It keeps me dry, warm, and comfortable. Except for my hands. The wrist snaps are TERRIBLE. You have to play with the velcro, repeatedly, in order to get it to stick, and it never really sticks together tight enough for my liking. The rest of the jacket looks and feels expensive. This feels really, really cheap, as if it was simply an afterthought. The front pockets have no liner! I was shocked that on a jacket that retailed for $300 they overlooked that. I decided to try out the jacket anyway, thinking it couldn't be that bad. It is that bad. Because the pockets are in front of the inner jacket, you have no additional wind protection or warmth. All though the jacket itself doesn't let wind in, it makes the shell really cold, and that in turn, makes your hands really cold. I needed a good pair of gloves anyway, but it is unfortunate that I have to buy them because of this jacket. 

This DWR makes me nervous. While it does a great job repelling big droplets, in the mist or very light rain however, water seems to stick. I have only worn the jacket in the rain three times. The first two times were in heavy rain for more than 15 minutes at a time with no problems. The third time was mist for about 20 minutes at a time, and when I got in my car, I noticed very small 'wet' spots on the jacket, around my front pockets. Regardless of the droplet size, I would assume it should bead right off because it was new. I am going to apply a ton of my own waterproofing because I don't want to risk it in the future if I need to stay dry, but before I do so I am going to wear it in the rain again just to be sure.

This jacket retails for $300 new. Had I paid $300, I would be upset and likely attempted to return the jacket. But, because Backcountry has great sales, I got it on sale and got free 2 day shipping (How to create a loyal customer). If you need a shell for skiing or snowboarding or just cold weather, consider this jacket. It has a great range of movement and I am more than warm enough in 28-35 degree weather with just a t shirt on underneath. It keeps the wind out, and unless I got a lemon, it will keep you dry for a long time. The velcro at the wrists sucks, and the front pockets offer no warmth, so you have been warned.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-07 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

So I thought that this coat was a no-brainer: I liked the style and color, and wanted something that was soft and fluffy. I regretted this almost immediately. As is my wont, I washed it (#1) before wearing it. Upon my first wearing, the coat shed copious amounts of fleece fluff everywhere: my gym bag (which looked like it had grown fuzzy grey mold), car (the seatbelts were absolutely coated), my clothes, everywhere. So I washed it (#2) along with my towels and bedding: big mistake. Now I had fleece fluff on my towels (I wound up with fleece stuck to my skin every time I dried off with the fluff-contaminated towels). So I washed it, without even wearing it, alone (#3), and thought I was safe. WRONG. Once again, it shed fleece like an Alaskan Husky shedding its winter coat. So, feeling that I must have reached a turning point (a feeling that turned out to be hugely unjustified), I washed it again (#4: bear in mind I've had this coat for 8 days at this point) with other clothes, and I think that I don't have to tell you what happened, except to say that I've gone through 2 lint rollers as well (it took me 15 min to roll the lint off a black cotton T shirt, after washing it again did not remove the fleece fluff). Since I don't want to 1) unnecessarily increase my carbon footprint by continuously washing it until it stops shedding, and 2) inflict this coat on someone else (donating this coat would only pass this headache to someone else), I regretfully will be throwing this away.

At 11,500', on a ledge, and in 50+ gusts, these tents stood strong like you wouldn't believe. Guy'd out at all the points, it was a stable structure that surprised all 4 of us. We were a little skeptical since they are 3 season lightweight backpacking tents, but when the winds started and they were still unscathed in the morning, we all agreed that if we were in the market for a tent, this would be our first choice. We opted to try lighter since it is quite the hike in from the trailhead and we had a couple full racks of climbing gear and ropes. The mesh helps circulate air through and the fly helps create a bomber structure. The one pole system was quick and easy to set up and overall the tent has a fairly small footprint but is still comfortable for two people. The vestibules create protected space for your gear and weren't overly cramped as some can be. The footprint is a little confusing since it is a little large, but with some creativity it's easy to use. The added bonus is that it comes with the footprint, as most tents still don't. Don't hesitate to buy this tent. At a sub 3 pound weight for two people and the added value of a footprint included, this is not a bad purchase at all.

My issue with it is that the one large pocket is not in the most convenient location. I think 2 additional pockets near the doors (in those little triangles that the zipper curves away from) would have been ideal. But honestly, you can live without those pockets. 

As somebody else also mentioned, the tarp is a little on the large side. I guess that is so that it doesn't rip because it is too taut. The proposed workaround was to pit the poles through the tarp, then tent. It worked fine with that.

As for space, we were able to fit 2 pads side by side. See the picture.

I got it for 240 on sale. Considering that it came with a tarp for that price, I think it was a good deal.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-08-10 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

At most to do a full set up with rain fly and everything, you'd have guy out two points (vestibule doors). The vestibules are so spacious, I probably could have saved myself some weight and gone with the one person version. The included footprint is kind of ill fitting, but not enough to be a hassle (I found if you put the foot print loops on the poles first, and then the tent loops, the tent loops hold everything together nicely). There's a lot headroom which I like. I'm 6', and 215lbs, I never felt crowded in this tent. Over all I like the tent, but I'm not in love with it yet. 

The included gear loft is kind of wank on The North Face's part. It's a large mesh pocket at the head of the tent. Not a gear loft you clip on with hooks like other tents. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-04-04 00:00:00","",""

I love how small this packs down, even with the footprint and rain fly. I was able to strap it all down on the bottom, outside of my pack, which gave me tons of extra room, inside. The width is just enough for two pads, but there's plenty of room for your gear to be stored either at your head, feet, or in the vestibules. 

There is an upgrade on this 2016 version, from last years. It is free standing. This is a huge plus for me, because I never know where I will be pitching the tent. In this photo, I had to stake two corners of the tent down. The dirt was rock hard and basically impossible to drive a stake in. Plus, sometimes a flat rock, is the best spot for a tent. So, this freestanding feature is a huge bonus!

Sitting up is a dream. There is plenty of head room. Also, the views this provides, without the rain fly, are gorgeous. 360 degrees, can't complain! 

This is easy, easy, easy to set up. I figured it out, without reading any instructions.

The lining is slick so it’s very easy to get in and out of.  I wanted a cold weather coat that would spend a lot of time in the driver’s seat so I’m pleased that although the hood is insulated, it’s not bulky and the elastic adjustment cords hold their adjustment so I can just flip it up when I leave the car.  The hood does not have a size adjustment so to get the large hood to stay put in the wind, it has to be tightened such that it covers my eyes.  Fortunately, wearing a baseball cap solves the problem and reduces glare at the same time.  The cuffs are loose at the wrist as are the elastic fabric seals but if I’m going to be out very long in the type of weather this coat is meant for, I wear gloves that go up into the sleeves and seal the union nicely.  The hem of the jacket has an elastic drawstring that can be used to make small adjustments at the hips.  The extra cord goes into the hand pockets so that it does not hang out of the bottom of the jacket.  I bought mine in Banff Blue and the picture accurately represents the color.  The wind blocking ability and insulation make this jacket about all I can stand while in a car.  The next step in warmth would have to be either a full-on parka or a size larger choice that would allow a mid-layer fleece.
Size: I am 5’10”, 180lbs and if my pants are sized honestly, I wear a 36/31.  I bought a large and over a heavy flannel shirt it fits perfectly.  The torso length too is correct as it just touches the bottom of the car’s seat. When standing, the sleeves stop just at the top knuckle of my thumbs.  That’s a good thing, since there’s no Velcro strap on the sleeves so if they were any longer I would look like I borrowed my big brother’s jacket.

The Canyonlands fleece pullover has a nice, tapered, athletic cut so expect the jacket to fit more on the snug side.

QUALITY:
As with most TFN products, the quality of the fleece is outstanding. Keep in mind this is a very light-weight jacket so it feels a little thin. Don't let that fool you as this mid-layer will keep you plenty warm in cool conditions. However, if you're anticipating extreme weather, you will probably want something warmer.

USE:
I use this jacket over my base-layer while hiking. It's very lightweight and easily stowable in your pack. The extended zipper allows for extra breathability and the chest pocket is convenient for storing small items.

"The North Face","Ballard Lace II Boot - Women's","110199632",5,"I've been looking for a casual street boot that has the same amount of function as say, a hiking or approach shoe. The problem I have with most women's casual boots is that they usually have useless features, like a fashion zipper even though the boot is meant to be a lace up. Or the soles are hard plastic and do not provide any sort of support or traction. 

The Ballard boots are everything I was looking for. They get 5 stars for comfort, appearance, and function. The metal eyelets are a smart touch as they tend to last longer than traditional fabric ones. I also love that there's no fashion zipper -- just the laces. The soles are made out of a durable rubber and provide really great support and traction. There is also enough space to wear thick wool socks on colder fall days. Also, the top of the boot comes a few inches above my ankle,  providing more warmth and ankle support and making it easy to wear with cuffed jeans or socks over leggings. 

As for the ""poor quality"" of leather,  I have to disagree with the rest of the reviews. I purchased these boots expecting a more rustic, rugged look to the leather, and that's exactly how they look in person. Yeah, the photos are just bit shinier, but if you want a smooth/polished leather boot, these are not for you. 

It's been a dry season in Utah, so there hasn't been any rain for me to test these out in, but I have no doubts that they will stand up to the elements and last me for years to come!

They have worn them everyday since their arrival and love  them.  They've received compliments on them from several people.  Thanks so much for that coupon code and for stocking these great coats!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-11-29 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

The pros: the fleece is super soft, the styling of the jacket is awesome and I was super impressed by the quality of the finishing.  The zipper for the fleece lining actually tucks into a little flap at the neck line which avoids that really uncomfortable chafing - somebody wore her thinking cap with that touch! Also, the snaps to keep the lining in place were secure enough to hold it in place... no awkward bunching and pulling.  Also, as a big girl, I found that the jacket fit really well across the chest and arms, which was a great delight!
The cons: the fleece was a collection of annoying pills the second it got wet... and wet it got.  The fabric of the jacket was waterproof, but the pulling around the hood meant that the rain soaked in around my neck.  Also, while the length was awesome, it was super tight around my hips.

Also, getting the fleece sleeves in and out of the jacket was not as simple as it should be. Sizing wise - I have a medium frame, so I got a large...fit nicely, however I have broad shoulders so when I would stretch out my arms the sleeves would be too short.

If you get too warm going with the wind, just unzip it a bit and you're good to go. The build quality is just that, quality. The thumb holes have extra stitching to prevent tear outs on either end and there's a headphone cable tie on the inside flap to prevent movement.

"The North Face","Kilowatt Jacket - Men's","2104585795",4,"One cold day I decided I needed another active jacket in my quiver of gear, so I chose to give The North Face Kilowatt jacket a try.

The jacket is basically a hybrid of a softshell and a hoody. The body and hood is water-repellent, wind-resistant, while the sleeves are breathable knit fleece. The result is a jacket that stands up to less-than-ideal weather conditions but remains breathable when the activity level turns up.

But how does it work in real life?

THE LIKEY: I found the jacket to be ideal for numerous mid-to-high intensity actvities, anywhere from shoveling snow to a chilly run on a winter's morn. The body and hood keeps snow and light rain away, and the breathable sleeves aid in keeping you dry as well as warm. The hood is very roomy, and will accommodate a helmet with no problem. The thumb holes are a nifty addition as it provides some wearing options. There is also a media port in the handwarmer pocket and a neat little clip along the zipper for headphones.

THE MEH: The hood is pretty large, even for my big melon. And it's not adjustable, which means you'll be rocking an Assassin's Creed look if you're not wearing a helmet or  beanie. I found the sleeves to be a bit long as well, but that is most likely to accomodate the thumbholes. In addition, since they're fleece, they will get wet and the wind cuts right through, although they will dry quickly and you probably won't notice too much with a baselayer.

THE TAKEAWAY: This is a great jacket for active pursuits in cold (but not ice planet Hoth) conditions. Weather resistant, breathable and comfy to boot. Definitely a jacket that will see regular use.

"The North Face","O2 Tent - 2-Person 3-Season","109902094",3,"So I got this tent a little over a year ago, when I started my job on a trail building crew because of its light weight and how weather resistant it seemed. Since then I have camped with this tent extensively (as in four nights a week every week for the entier summer.) And have put it through a number of incredibly different weather conditions and environments. Overall it is a good tent, but I don't think it is a good enough tent for how extensively I use it and while most of the time it works well there are somethings about it that make it only suitable for a lighter variety of camping and backpacking. One of its biggest downfalls is that its durability is very little. Three weeks after I bought it and one windstorm later the U shaped poll that holds it up had bent. Which was unfortunate. Even so generally it does  hold up in stronger winds, just not really strong winds (the stakes have a tendency of ripping out of the ground). The rain fly works rather well and its design keeps water from being anywhere near the base of the tent. This like the rest of the tent only rings true to a certain point though and I've found that during monsoon season after hours of continuous rainfall water will pool on the top of the tent an the rain fly can leak, but usually not much. The most disappointing thing is its durability.  The mesh is very thin and will pull and scrunch up in places after your first use. For me this wasn't an issue because bugs where still kept at bay but it was pretty disappointing because the other dome tents I had never had this issue. The rain fly connecters also ended up ripping off, which was awkward.  
Overall this tent has kept me warm and dry when I needed it to most, but its been bearly a year and I'm already sending it in for its warranty after a summer of use. So I think this tent would be great for those who don't use their tents almost constantly, but for me it was not durable enough and began to fall apart after a few months.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-07-12 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

I'm 6'2"", and my son 6', and we both slept comfortably, to my surprise.  Survived a moderate rainfall with no problem.  Always nice to see rain beading up on fresh waterproof nylon.  Nice how the rain fly extends a fair distance from the tent floor.  Was looking for a light tent to use solo, and the 02 is as light as every solo tent on the market.  A smart design all around.  I cut out a ground tarp to protect the thin floor material.  Cheers!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-06-02 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"The North Face","O2 Tent - 2-Person 3-Season","2024101472",5,"I've used the tent several times now. I've used it in heavy rain, hot weather and cool weather. It goes up easy and I sometimes restake a corner or two after getting it up. It's about 2 lbs. 6 oz. as it comes. I replaced the stakes with MSR Carbon stakes to lower weight to 2 lbs. 4 oz. The tent is a little shorter than the specs, but will still fit a long thermarest pad. It held up well in heavy steady rain and no rain got inside. My mesh has a few places on the door that look like the first reviewer's tent, but no problems with it. I think the mesh stretched a little and just looks like that. No bugs get in though, so I'm not sure why the first person had a problem. NF has lifetime warranty also, so I'm not sure why he had problems with NF. Tent packs very small and fits inside even a day pack, which I use for solo overnights. Plenty wide inside for one person and all gear. Not sure if I would try sleeping two in the tent, unless smaller couple that likes to snuggle. Side door is good and allows easy in and out. The vaulted ends are great, as most tents lose height at the ends. Can't use trekking poles on the ends as they don't fit. Overall very pleased and it is my go to tent unless my teenage son is with me. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-03-15 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"The North Face","O2 Tent - 2-Person 3-Season","106317453",1,"I bought this tent and after the first night i used it, bugs had managed to pry holes in the mesh. I had to cut my trip short, return home and return the tent. I was offered a replacement or repair (at either cost or no cost to me depending on an evaluation after i had shipped the tent to California, i live over the other side of the world, and paid for the shipping) but I wasn't happy owning a brand new tent that had been repaired after the first time i have used it, especially when all i did was sleep in it and did not damage it myself, or having a replacement tent which may have the same problem if its a factory fault. I didn't even camp anywhere which had extreme conditions or wildlife.

I asked several experts and well known tent sellers and they all said they have never seen this before but bugs shouldn't be able to break through a 'no-see-um' mesh otherwise what would be the point of having the bug protection system.

Anyway, see the pictures for yourself. Other than this problem, i loved the tent, the pack size and weight, and it's great for a one person. Easy to set up and not as expensive as some other tents in the same category. I'm just sad that i had to change tents and change brands because of the lack of an amicable solution (North Face haven't been very helpful), and this unbearable problem.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-07-15 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

The no-see-um mesh is great for keeping out creepy crawlers and the door was even wide enough for me to sneak a bouldering pad in there with me (in place of a sleeping pad). The tent performed well in rain storms from light drizzles to heavy down pours although I don't know how well it holds up in wind storms yet. Perhaps the most enticing part of the tent is the weight, at 1 lbs 5 oz - 2 lbs 4 oz, this tent is light as a feather and takes up minimal room in your pack, making packing light and easy. Finally, there isn't a ton of vestibule space, but enough for your boots and a small bag if necessary.

I hike weekly in the Pacific NW, usually between 4-8 miles.

Initial Thoughts:
I rotate these boots with a pair of low-top North Face hiking shoes and I think I prefer these. Even tho they are mid-top, they feel less 'clunky' and are lighter than the low-tops I have. 

They're waterproof / goretex - useful in the cool, wet falls of PNW, but I wouldn't plan on wearing these year-round. The few times I have worn them it has been cool / raining / damp and they've kept my feet dry. Great grip on the soles, even on wet rocks and roots, and they're pretty much good to wear out of the box - not much break-in time required - this is a great boot for weekend day hikers.

Sizing:
I am normally a Size 10; these are just the slightest bit roomy at Size 10.  I combat this with thicker socks and inserts. Would recommend trying a half-size down.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-10-04 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

Despite that, I made the two day trip with only one very small hot spot forming and they were comfortable in everything from the 80 degree approach to the snow field traverse in crampons to the fairly technical rock scramble.

I bought them a full size bigger than my regular show size and with liner socks and regular socks they were a perfect fit.  Extremely light too, essentially weighing no significant amount more than my standard hiking boots.  The only downside is they don't breathe quite as well as my summer hiking boots, however they are EXTREMELY warm so this is to be expected.

I wore a thin wool sock as I usually do but found my feet a bit chilled.  I was disappointed by this as the temperatures were in the 30s and 40s during the climb.  I think my feet would have been warmer in a larger boot.
I've experienced many problems with LaSportiva (both hard shell and Evos) with the design of the boot's tongue.  There is a break between the area of the foot and the shin and I have had horrible abrasion problems because of that.  The North Face boots have a very comfortable tongue that is a continuous piece.

We climbed up into knee to hip high fresh powder snow. Breaking trail and kicking steps was not a problem. Due to the worse than expected conditions we never made it to the peak but my feet were never a concern. I had solid footing and could manoeuvre well, and the S6K's never gave me any blisters or painful spots around the ankles or shins. 

I have narrow feet. They have a tight locking heel and a little bit wider toe box that I think works well for narrow to normal feet. I think if you have wide feet these will not work for you.

I hopefully get to test these more this winter but my initial impression is that I'm very very glad I bought these. Light, and comfortable, but solid boots with a full shank that take any crampons if needed. 

Update - climbing a mix of stomped down/icy snow and fresh powder yesterday confirmed my previous impressions.  

I had packed but left my crampons and was debating climbing up as the trail started steep and icy. The hard sole, front crampon well and relatively sharp side edge of the Verto S6K, allowed me to kick hard enough to get just that little edge I needed.

I don't have a Shrek-sized head but apparently it's a little larger than average so I was a bit hesitant from some of the reviews mentioning it running small. 

While that's true, and I would say it does run a little small, I found it still covers my ears (hmm...maybe in addition to a slightly larger head, my ears are just really high up?) Regardless, the fit was right on.

But, besides the amazing price that Backcountry offered, the star of this item is the comfort. I had no idea there were SO MANY choices in beanies and I was getting overwhelmed. But I decided to pull the trigger on this one and am extremely pleased. I've never worn such a comfortable beanie and it's that simple fleece liner that makes all the difference.

The other thing I love about this beanie is that it dries amazingly fast. When I got it I hand-washed it and layed it flat on the back of a chair (indoors) and it was dry in less than an hour. I'm sure that would be minutes if it was outside.

I too wear a M/L Giro bike helmet and these North Face hats fit me perfectly.  They are snug but not too tight.

I figured if one North Face hat fits me well then another would too.  It does.
For bitter cold and high wind I have a wind stopper hat.  But for average chilly days and basic bummin' around these more breathable hats are fantastic.  Super comfortable for running.  The inner fleece headband adds warmth and my head does not get sweaty.

The hood is roomy enough to fit a small pillow and keep it in place, the zipper pull glows so you can easily find it in the dark, and there's a small inside pocket which is nice if you need to keep something close and easily accessible.

After personally using a Women’s North Face Recon Backpack for a semester at college, I can provide you with product details and help you answer your question. 

Details:

The Women’s Recon Backpack was built especially for students who are on the go. This backpack will help you stay organized as you travel between classes. The best feature, it comes with is a protective laptop sleeve and lots of easy access storage compartments. The main compartment allows you to carry numerous books and notepads. One negative side to carrying a large load is that the backpack won’t remain in an upright position when placed on the floor. Fortunately, the backpack’s material remains to provide a lightweight feel. 
When traveling to classes, this backpack will deliver you maximum comfort. The shoulder straps and back panel are equipped with padding to allow for support and wicks away moisture during those warm days. Although the straps are helpful to adjust to different comfort preferences, they can become easily caught on the bus or chairs and cause minor frustration. On dreadful rainy days, the Women’s Recon backpack’s water resistant material will protect your supplies from water damage. 

Durability:

Another question you may have is: If I spend this much will it last me a long time? The answer is yes! The Women’s Recon Backpack material is very durable and long lasting. You don’t have to worry about cheap zippers that snag or become dysfunctional. The zippers and material are extremely strong and hard-wearing. After extensive usage of the backpack, it still looks brand-new. It shows minimal signs of wear or tear and remains functioning outstanding. 

My experience using the North Face Women’s Recon Backpack has been extremely positive and that’s the reason for a 5-star rating. If you want a stylish, comfortable, and durable backpack, this is the right choice. The high quality material can help you stay organized and carry your supplies to class with ease. Your first day back to classes will be more enjoyable with a Women’s Recon Backpack on your shoulders.

The protection needed for the laptop pocket (which I love!!) makes it very stiff.  Because of that, and the fact that the zippers only go halfway down the sides, it really doesn't open very well if you need to put larger things in.  On the positive side, it is so comfortable on my back! The straps are padded, the color is great, the side pockets are roomy without being loose.  Overall, it's a great backpack.

"The North Face","Recon 31L Backpack - Women's","2132897",4,"I've been using this backpack for a little over a month now.  While it's certainly getting the job done, I can't say I love it.  I travel via train and longboard to/from work every day, so I needed a good commuter backpack.  Some key features I was looking for were size, durability, pockets, and room for a bicycle light.  I needed a bag large enough to hold my uniforms, a spare change of clothes, shoes, snacks, etc.  It was also a must to find a pack that had side water bottle pockets for quick access that would be large enough to store a 32 oz. Nalgene bottle and a 17 oz. Hydro Flask food flask.  

While I am happy with the bicycle light attachment and side water bottle pockets (success for both the Nalgene and Hydro Flask!), I am not 100% thrilled on the design of the sizing.  The backpack is definitely large -- it fits a decent amount of gear, but it is pretty slim.  It gets its size in its length and width, but it is not very deep.  It's long in length so stuff seems to fall into a ""blackhole"" and since it's not very wide, you'll have a narrow opening to go searching for everything.  (In this case, I'm referring to depth as the distance the pack extends outward from my back; length as the distance from my shoulders to my hips; and width as distance from shoulder to shoulder.)  Lucky for me, I have broad shoulder and a broad back, so the large width isn't too much of a problem for me, but as a women's backpack, other women with smaller backs might find this pack a little large.  Additionally, the pack panel has a thick padding for added comfort (nice!) but it is lined with a pretty rigid plastic of some sort, making it a little cumbersome when trying to pack it.

Another issue I have is that the bottom of the backpack angles upward a bit, meaning that the bottom of the bag does not sit flat on the ground.  With the rigid plastic lining on the back padding, the pack does not sit up straight when placed on the floor or on any flat surface -- it will tip forwards.

Overall, it is a durable backpack that will certainly hold enough stuff for a day trip as long as you don't mind digging deep for your gear.  I purchased mine in Lagoon Iridescent Print/Asphalt Grey and it's a very nice color.  ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-11-30 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

Though I don't find it to be the LIGHTEST of all packs, it still beat the Patagonia and the Kelty bags I was deciding upon.

I also don't like having to remove my gloves to do simple chores around camp and I've found these to serve that purpose well. 

Because of their design they can also work under heavier gloves and have proven to be relatively weather resistant. They're not waterproof though so keep that in mind. 

While there is an extra piece of material sewn in between the thumb and forefinger, a heavy use area for poles, I did notice some pilling almost immediately on the little finger. Not sure about the long-term durability with these but I've had good luck with TNF in the past. 

I also appreciate the very small and inconspicuous buckle that allows you to snap the two gloves together when not in use.

Third, the feel;  the padding on the back line and the straps are such an added bonus. I've had back issues in the past and this padding  does add comfort while hauling all my stuff on long days. Also, the backpack itself is light and doesn't really add any additional weight to what I have to already carry. The whistle on the chest strap is an added bonus too (it works and its loud!).

"The North Face","Triarch 2 Tent: 2-Person 3-Season","665549796",5,"I've field tested this about 5x thus far.

For context, I own/have owned about 15 tents in the last few years, including Big Agnes Copper spurs, REI quarter domes, North Face, Nemo, etc.  

I bought the Triarch because I've always been happy or impressed with North Face gear.  They get flack for their commercial success and diversity/mainstream-ness of products, but they've been around and successful for a reason.   The Triarch appears to  have been made as a competitor to the other ultralight but strong options on the market, such as the copper spur series.  

A bit heavier, but with some quality improvements in features.  

One, the heavier floor fabric and coating.  A common complaint of ultralight tents is the lightweight floor fabric that tears or has need for a footprint.  I've personally never had any floor issues on those light tents, but I choose my pitch spots carefully, remove sharp objects, and generally respect the utility of the gear and limits. 

However the Triarch floor material is a bit beefier and durable, and it's noticeable.  It comes with the footprint, but if you won't be camping on rock or scree, I think you can get away with leaving it at home and shedding a bit of that extra weight.  

Two, my favorite feature is the extended head/foot end points, created by the spine pole extending outwards a bit before attaching.  This creates some space right where you need it.  Ever have the problem of your head or feet rubbing against the ends of the tent?  Boom, gone.  Also helps with gear loft placement, keeps it from taking up interior space or hanging down over you.  Which btw, gear lofts aplenty in this guy, unlike the copper spurs.

This also features modern door design for easier in/out access, makes accessing gear or shielding bugs easier, in addition to just swinging your legs out.  Zippers flow quickly without snags.

Main complaint would probably just be color?  It's the normal NF color scheme, which looks fine, and I appreciate the bright color in winter on the snow for safety-sake, but green seasons it would be great to go more incognito.  

There are cheaper options that do a good job, but I think if you're looking between the copper spur (which is a warrior, and has few real rivals), this may be a better option.  ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-07-12 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

Like any slightly nervous but mostly excited consumer I settled on this tent after much research. I had read on GearFinder, Adventure Centre LTD, and The House that the floor space length was 84in, this is false. After setting it up and measuring it myself the true length is closer to 74in. As a 6'6"" male this was one of the most important aspects of the tent.

"The North Face","Triarch 2 Tent: 2-Person 3-Season","4660976",4,"I have just received this tent, which I hurried to pitch up in my garden. 

As expected, the tent weighs more than the manufacturer's data.
I used a precision balance, here is the verdict:
Total weight, complete with all the elements, 2055 gr - 4lb 8.5 oz (But without  gear loft, missing!)
Weight without footprint,                                1833 gr - 4lb 1oz
One can easily replace this footprint by Polycree,(or DuPont's Tyvek) very durable and three times lighter ... A piece of 8x5 ft = 2.5 oz . Just a few bucks...

It's a quality tent with good materials. Easy to pitch up.
Roomy!

I propose easy tricks to make this tent more wind resistant, with a budget of only $ 10/15 by purchasing 10 yds of 3 mm guyline and 4 or 6 stakes (6 or 7 inches long).
Simply attach the guyline to the middle clip on the main pole,
and secure to the floor with a stake each side. Do this again for the second clip.
The guyline never touches the inner tent!
Do the same on the highest clip of the tent. You must tie guyline with a clove hitch
almost at the end of the short pole above the door.  Then pass the string through the  roof ventilation event of the fly, on both sides, and fix the floor with stakes.
This never hinders access to the inner tent.
Then finish installing the fly...
These improvements add only 6.5 ounces, but your tent becomes much stronger in windy conditions.

Apses are small, and fly is a little bit short (better venting), so you must provide a big garbage bag if you want to find your backpack dry after a rainy night.

I'll write a review in mountain conditions as soon as possible...

It was a quick less than five minute set up in my living room. I crawled inside initially noticed that this tent feels significantly smaller than the zephyr. It is not as tall or wide. I can comfortabley sit upright with my legs crossed  in the center. I have plenty of room lengthwise 12+"" due to my height and could easily fit my pack inside.

Like other reviews, I agree that when the fly is on, there's not much air flow. This tent would definitely keep you warm in the folder months and I could see condensation becoming a problem if you don't undo the fly for some ventilation. I also feel like the overall quality of the tent, compared to the zephyr, is better. I feel like it's would do a better job at keeping me both dry and warm, probably because the walls aren't all completely mesh.

My 65# German Shepherd fits snugly at my side up at my shoulder or could sleep at my feet where she'd have more room on the tapered end.

The backward ""D"" door has two zippers to open in either direction. There is a loop and toggle to roll and keep the door out of the way if you don't need it. There's a large mesh pocket approximately 6""x16"" on the inside right wall of the tent (looking out). The bathtub floor comes up 7"" at it's lowest point.

Overall, j really like this tent. Plus it's my favorite color, yellow! I think I'll keep this one because I feel like this tent would last a lot longer than the zephyr. I'd sacrifice some size for quality, plus this tent I believe is lighter in weight. I can't wait to use it.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-06-26 00:00:00","",""

Also, the Stormbreak 1 feels a lot more solid and durable than the Seedhouse SL1, which is probably why the Stormbreak is heavier than the Seedhouse.

Little background on this, I usually hammock camp so I wanted to find a decent little 1-man tent for situations when a hammock may not be the best option or when I just don't feel like stringing up a hammock. I realize that it's a 3-season tent and winter isn't a fair test of it's abilities but to be honest, it really wasn't that bad.

The rain fly deflects wind nicely, the vestibule is big enough for my boots and I love the little pockets on the inside near the door for things like my phone, glasses, and light. The size of the tent is a little tight (it's a 1-man, duh). I'm 5'8"" and a average build guy and I fit perfectly.

Being a bit of a gear junkie, I searched high and low for a pack that did it all or came as close to hitting all my marks and then some.  Given my need only for a pack to help me shlep (way too much) gear to and from the various crags of Southern California, I did not want a highly technical alpine-style pack that would suggest I was a badass mountaineer (I just can't pull that off - yet).  Of all the packs I tried out, the Cragaconda was the only one that successfully swallowed all my gear (and then some), carried exceptionally comfortably, and is constructed so well that I see it lasting well into the zombie apocalypse.  The designers clearly put a lot of thought into each and every feature within its body.  If this pack had a power animal, it would definitely be an Anaconda.  Its seemingly diminutive appearance belies just how many items can be stuffed down its gullet.  Its wonderfully articulated, breathable straps and removable, padded hip belt constrict expertly around my modest frame and displace my overzealous loads with such efficiency so as to make me [almost] forget I am carrying too many things to the crag at all!  My only complaint is that there is neither a hydration bladder sleeve nor expandable, mesh side panels for water bottles.  Nonetheless, you can still cram life's necessities into the pack's confines and carry them comfortably if so inclined.

I chose TNF because of their reputation for having top notch bags. I was not disappointed in my decision. The size of the bag is within the dimensions for American Airlines’ carry-on requirements. Also because it is soft sided like a duffle bag, you can squeeze a little more clothes into it and shove it into the bin. Another thing to consider is all the rage in carry-on aesthetics these days is to have four caster wheels on the bottom of your luggage. This is a terrible idea. For one, it robs you of precious space because the manufacture has to shrink the overall capacity of the bag to meet airline requirements. Second, to have a plastic and cheaply made caster wheel protruding so far out is begging to be broken off by the mishandling of the bag. I recommend this TNF bag because it uses two robust wheels that can’t be damaged.","EMPLOYEE","2017-08-06 00:00:00","I gave it as a gift but have feedback to share","true"

I've had this bag for 1.5 years, traveled on probably 30 flights all around the world.  It is by far the best bag I've owned and I would buy the exact one again.
I have the black which I think looks the best and I can pull it off even in pretty formal travel situations (business class or rolling into a client's office before a flight).
It it pretty simply inside - one main compartment which I like.  Its quick-access top-pocket is great - big enough to stash most anything last minute.
The finish, which in the black model, starts really sweet looking does get roughed up if you are forced to check it a bunch.  I seldom need to check it because it fits in all but the smallest planes. 
My only suggestion for the next gen of this is to have some sort of tie-downs inside so when it's not full, my gear doesn't all sink to the bottom.  I've thought about grabbing a bungee net because it has nice loop-straps on the inside sides.

I work for a professional BMW racing team as a fueler (the guy at the trunk of the car with the hoses in the pic) and travel quite frequently.  I looked into bags that met the airline dimensions of a carry on.  The Rolling Thunder 22in fit the bill.  Plenty of room for a small bag! Also, very easy to use with very strong wheels and handles to throw this bag up into the overhead storage.  This bag will expand a bit if you pack if full, so the only thing I recommend is when boarding on the plane and scanning for your seat...find a large open spot in the available overheads to fit your bag into, because it may have to go in sideways and not straight in.  Another option is have the airline do a gate check on the bag and save yourself a few bucks. This happened a few times on FULL flights and had no problem believing my bag would make it through the baggage handling of the airlines.  On a side note...going through TSA and the X-ray screening...this bag passes right through.  If you are a North Face customer or maybe not one and looking for a cool bag...I would recommend this to anyone needing a legit bag for a short trip...and also adds a little swag.

"The North Face","EZ Dolman Shirt - Women's","2461447",2,"I am not a fan of TNF, so straight-up you know my bias. Ever since the company moved full clothing production into SE Asia from Berkeley they have inconsistent sizing, and in particular, their women's sizing and dimensions reflect that of SE Asia rather than American Women who are in general, much taller, more muscular and (self included) fattier around the waist.  Wouldn't hesitate to replace my TNF sleeping bag but not sure I will try their clothes anytime soon.

That said, the EZ Dolman shirt is a loose fitting boxy fit.  I found the shirt too short on me and the arm holes small.  The rest of the shirt is blousey.  The tech material is lightweight and would work on a hot day hike.  I surmise the material will pill under the arms and on the front.
