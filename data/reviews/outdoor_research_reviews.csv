I bought this primarily as a cycling layer, but have used it casually a number of times as well. I bought this and the regular ferrosi, but ended up keeping this for a few reasons: trimmer fit, more durable fabric, and better chest pockets. 

The fit is trim but not tight, and has enough room for an R1 or other similar fleeces. If you want to layer something heavier like a down puffy, sizing up might be smart. The fabric blocks a reasonable amount of wind, but nothing compared to a hardshell or windstopper. I wanted something super breathable because I do run hot, and I can always add another layer. It's been in the 30's and my go-to is this plus a 200wt wool shirt for the ride into work. My favorite part is the double chest pockets with the mesh backing. They're super helpful for venting when it warms up in the afternoon and really were the feature that made me keep this instead of the regular ferrosi.

Given the chance, I'd change two things: the hood and cuffs. I prefer an under-helmet hood for jackets like these because they don't catch nearly as much wind when they're down. I would also like simple non-velco cuffs like the regular version. Both those are minor details, so still an awesome jacket.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-12-03 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

I've tried many types of hats to keep my pale, Irish skin from too much sun exposure.  This is the only hat that checks all the boxes to be considered useful.  The brim has a foam insert the is advertised as a floatation feature.  I can't speak to those capabilities, but the same foam insert keeps the brim from blowing up when breeze at the beach would norally fold the brim of your boonie hat.  I really liked this!

The hat is made of a light-weight material, with nicely placed vents to allow air in, and heat out.  This makes this a hat that you can keep on your head, not in your hand.  Most hats tend to make me too hot to keep it on my head, and also become saturated with sweat.  This hat has done a good job at making me feel cooler in the direct sun, and stay on my head.

So glad I did!

Bought this in XL and I actually have a hat that doesn't feel like it's cutting off blood to my brain while making me go bald at the same time.

The brim is huge, a solid 2 inches at least wider than the Columbia, and also keeps it's shape which I like. (The floppy look wasn't really my thing.) This has an Australian look to it, not sure how else to describe it.

My neck is covered, my forehead is covered, everything is covered! 

Well made, comfortable, breathing vents all the way around, this thing is fantastic...well worth what I paid and I'll do it again if need be.

Shipped quick, couldn't be happier really.

"Outdoor Research","Ferrosi Jacket - Men's","777944702",5,"I bought this to replace an old Patagonia Super Guide jacket, a piece I use for casual town wear as well as for layering in cold weather. The Ferrosi jacket is significantly lighter and softer, has essentially the same feature set, and costs less than the old Patagonia jacket. I've now used the Ferrosi for a month that included a 3 week trip to the UK. There I wore the jacket for both in town use and for days of hiking in the Scottish Highlands. Some impressions.

Fit. I'm 6', 200 lb, 44"" chest,  long arms. The size L Ferrosi fits well as long as I don't layer heavily underneath. The cut has a bit less taper than, say, Arc'teryx, where I have to go XL to get a fit. The Ferrosi body length is good (just above my crotch, and the arms are plenty long. Nice.

Features. Two hand warmer pockets and a chest pocket. No interior pockets. Bottom hem drawcord. That's about it. Oh, cuff ends have thumb loops; I thought this would be a useless feature, but the fabric is so soft that they actually work. 

Fabric. The Ferrosi fabric is a single-weave stretchwoven, relatively smooth outside, kind of nubby inside. Softer and lighter than double-weave stretchwovens I've worn. Very comfortable, fast drying, comfortable across a range of temperatures, and about as wind-resistant as heavier soft shells I've worn.

Performance. I wore this with a T-shirt beneath for 60s - 70s (F) days jetting around London - comfortable, didn't overheat. I wore it standing on a rainy train stop in Highland Scotland, and for walking the hills there - good wind resistance, shed rain, dried easily when given a chance. And everything in between.

I have used this jacket from summer to winter now in Colorado's high country to Utah's deserts and have been nothing but amazed.  The Cathode's ability to keep you the right temperature despite varied conditions and activity has amazed me. 

 The jacket preforms excellently for belaying, backpacking, ski touring, hiking, alpine running, and resort riding. Where the cathode really shines is keeping you warm, but not too warm, when you're moving. 

 It accomplishes this by combining the Pertex 20D where the insulation is and softshell under the arm and side of torso. What this does it keep the warmth in the baffles and not let it escape. The fabric repels wind and light moisture very well, though it means it does not breath well, but that's where the softshell shines. You are able to release extra heat and stay in the right zone. I find myself leaving this layer on much longer than any other layer I have. 

The Prima loft Gold is super light, warm, and continues to keep you warm even if you get the fabric wet. Which can happen from sweating or perception, so it makes this jacket much safer and more comfortable. 

It works well as your outer layer when skinning or hiking, or underneath a shell when the wind is ripping or its colder out. I am careful with the fabric, but it has stood up fine to light bush-wacking and rubbing up against rocks . The hood is very well designed and seals around your head well. It doesn't fit well over a helmet, but sits underneath nicely. It stuffs into it's own pocket nicely, and can compresses more once its in your pack.

When the wind picks up you definitely need a shell on top; cold wind rips right through the side and underarm fabric. It's not really a downside to me, since that why you bring a wind layer in the first place. I still notice the great breathability when it's under the shell, and it's a great layer paired with a microfleece and shell on cold days.

I normally run pretty hot and this jacket manages to keep me from overheating during any type of physical exertion.  The fit on this jacket is perfect.

The jacket shed all of the snow and was great until I stopped moving then I had to layer up for the night.

I definitely have to stretch the base to get the velcro to reach on the front, and it's a bit of a pull to get the lace hook low enough that I'm happy with it, but I end up with a slim fit along the calf (which I prefer) and a great seal along the bottom (I've worn them through small but rapid creek crossings that were higher than my boots and stayed dry).

Given my experience in seriously cold temps, I would go with a more insulated glove that is puffier.

Alti Mitts are way too thin in insulation and the Primaloft insulation by itself does not trap enough warm air (need some filler such as down).

I would not recommend using the inner liner by itself...it is not built heavily enough to use solo.  But as a combination, or with the outer shell alone, they're great.

Here's the design problem.  The lower third of the gaiter is made of a highly durable material (Cordura I believe?) that stands up very well to abrasion and nicks.  But the upper two thirds of the gaiter are made of a thin light-weight material (Gortex I believe?) that is easily shredded at the slightest touch of a crampon.  A better design would be to have the tough Cordura on the entire inner side of the leg, all the way up to the top of the gaiter, where inevitably it will come in contact with crampons every so often.  And then on the outer side of the leg, where there is no possibility of contact with crampons, the light-weight Gortex material can be used no problem.

So far, I've used them in, for example, a 10-mile hike in 18+ inches of snow; walking in ankle-deep water for a photography project on a Maine beach on a day when temperatures were -9F before factoring in the windchill; on a quick 20 mile overnight backpacking trip with conditions ranging from shin-deep mud on lower parts of the trail to climbing with crampons and an ice ax higher up. In each case I wore them with just my winter hiking boots--insulated Gore-tex lined LL Bean Crestas.  With the exception of a bit of mud on the bottom of my pants -- and then I think because I hadn't fastened the velcro carefully -- my feet stayed completely dry.  

My only minor quibble is, as others mention, with the sizing. Based on OR's sizing recommendations I should be a medium (I have a size 9 foot), but found that I had to tighten the closure to the point where the top of the gaiters were pleated to get a tight fit, unless I was wearing rain/snow gear. It didn't turn out to be a problem, but for others like me who are very thin it easily might be in warmer/dryer weather.

I had been planning to buy these for some time and had been unsure whether to get these or the somewhat heavier Expedition Crocodiles.

- Snow does creep up from the bottom, wedging itself between your boot and the gaiters and forming a mini-glacier on your feet.

I have housed a ton of stuff in my Outdoor Research Zip Sacks, including spoons, firestarters, headlamps, etc. I have never had mine tear or even wear out much if any in my backpacks. I throw my Outdoor Research Zip Sack into my backpack and don't look back. While not water proof, it is water resistant. So as long as you do not submerge it for minutes on end this will do the trick for keeping your backpacking gear relatively dry.

My experience with the Helium II has largely been as a ""just in case"" piece while rock climbing and hiking when the weather is iffy. This jacket packs up quickly inside its stow pocket to about the size of a baseball - I have found the pocket is big enough to hold the jacket as well as a small snack and still be compact and light enough to forget about while clipped to my harness or tucked away in my backpack top pocket.

Considering the thin 30D Pertex Shield fabric is almost transparent, I was a bit worried about durability issues when I first got my hands on the jacket. But, after a trip alpine climbing in Canada's Northwest Territories my skepticism diminished; I ended up wearing the Helium almost continuously during my trip including two separate (20+ hour) big wall climbs in which we climbed loads of squeeze chimneys (hood fits nicely over my helmet!): Not one hole and the jacket was quite comfortable whilst climbing and hiking between tormenting cloudbursts! 

I would not necessarily suggest this jacket for use if you will be inundated by wet weather for days on end, that said, I have used this it as a standalone piece for backcountry use in remote and wet locations with the knowledge that it does not have the best breathability like other, more robust Outdoor Research jackets - It does however dry fast!

My experience with the Helium II has largely been as a ""just in case"" piece while rock climbing and hiking when the weather is iffy. This jacket packs up quickly inside its stow pocket to about the size of a baseball - I have found the pocket is big enough to hold the jacket as well as a small snack and still be compact and light enough to forget about while clipped to my harness or tucked away in my backpack top pocket.

Considering the thin 30D Pertex Shield fabric is almost transparent, I was a bit worried about durability issues when I first got my hands on the jacket. But, after a trip alpine climbing in Canada's Northwest Territories my skepticism diminished; I ended up wearing the Helium almost continuously during my trip including two separate (20+ hour) big wall climbs in which we climbed loads of squeeze chimneys (hood fits nicely over my helmet!): Not one hole and the jacket was quite comfortable whilst climbing and hiking between tormenting cloudbursts! 

I would not necessarily suggest this jacket for use if you will be inundated by wet weather for days on end, that said, I have used this it as a standalone piece for backcountry use in remote and wet locations with the knowledge that it does not have the best breathability like other, more robust Outdoor Research jackets - It does however dry fast!

The material feels really lightweight, hard to believe it's as waterproof as it is - but so far rain beads up nicely on it (unlike a couple other light rain jackets I tried).  Fairly breathable - no pit zips, but can always leave the front open or leave the bungies loose.

I don't really miss the pit zips or hip pockets on this - it's not what I bought it for.  I have another rain jacket - a bomber goretex shell with pockets, pit zips, etc- so for colder weather, longer trips, etc I've got that one - but it's bulkier (can't clip to harness for windy belay stations and takes up most of the hydration pack or must be bungy'd to the back).

So much about what works and what doesn't has to do with how easy they are to take on and off (as one unit) vs. how difficult it is to just remove the shell and then get your lined-hand back inside with a minimum of fuss.

On these two fronts, these gloves score extremely well.  Selectively removing the whole mitt vs. just the outer glove works easy every time.   I was running a rifle range last weekend with these on, and it was easy to manage my various tasks including shooting with the liner on.

The mitts have a huge tether string which easily finds its way inside the outer mitten and does not disturb.  Hand warmer pockets, removable fingers for the liner mitt, and magnets (yes MAGNETS!) to keep the inner liner in place.  Nice design.   They shed water and dirt quite well and have a nice finger loop for hanging them up to dry.

Complaints?  The thumb is tight, as is the width of the palm.   The palm is more bothersome, but I suspect that if it was really really cold, the thumb would be the bigger factor.  Size up!

"Outdoor Research","Transcendent Down Sweater - Men's","2312342",4,"So I recently purchased 7 different down jackets so I could wear and compare and select the one I liked best. This was my great down jacket review, not because the review was great, but because the breadth of comparisons was pretty extensive. The ones I compared were the Marmot Zeus, Marmot Tullus, Mountain Hardware Nitrous, Mountain Hardwear Micro Ratio, Patagonia Down Sweater, The North Face Trevail, and the Outdoor Research Tanscendent. I'll put comments on the others in the listings for each. The reason I selected these are that they all are basically medium-weight down jackets (not extreme light or heavy) and were comparable on the prices. Backcountry was having a sale and all these were marked down to between $123 to $160. 
What I wanted was a top layer jacket without a hood (don't use hoods very often). I generally don't use down jackets like these as a layer under anything because of their bulk. I prefer a synthetic for that. I have a huge down jacket with a hood for very cold weather. I wanted one that was less bulky and more suitable for activities. 
So the Tanscendent. The Tanscendent was a nice jacket and I'm rating it pretty good based on features and construction -- because it's a nice jacket. However I returned it because it didn't fit me right. The one I had was Dusk/Night and it's a nice looking color. 
Fit: The fit was good through the body  but was too big in the arms - circumference. I usually get an XL because of wide shoulders and long arms. I think the Large would have fit my arms better but it would have been too small in the torso. The bottom of the jacket hit between the top of my pelvis and my hip joints. The fit looks good through the shoulders. What I mean by that is that it doesn't look too square or too slouchy. I have a Marmot Quasar (ultra-light down) that is really square in the shoulders. As a result it looks kind of weird and pointy at the end of the shoulders. This one looks more natural. 
Comfort: The jacket was very comfortable. The fabric feels good to the touch and the jacket is quiet when moving. The hand pockets are a bit more to the side than I would have liked and the openings could be a bit more angled. Neck and cuffs are basic but fine. 
I ended up returning the Tanscendent and choosing the Patagonia Down Sweater as it felt a bit warmer, and lighter (800-fill down vs the Tullus' 650-fill down). However, this jacket is a good value - if the fit works for you.

I am a 34 waist in every pair of OR pants I own, but these seemed to have mixed reviews. Some say they are huge and to size down, some say they are right on the money. I am here to tell you that they fit exactly as advertised. The 34 waist fits perfectly on me. I ordered the 32 waist just for comparison and while I could get them on I'm not sure ""hot pants"" are a flattering look on me. So if you are trying to figure out what size to get I suggest go with your usual size.

Function: I was immediately surprised at how light these pants are. I have had other soft shell style pants but these blow them out of the water as far as weight. I could probably wear them on the hottest most humid summer day and have no discomfort. They fit nice as well and I could get away wearing them in a professional environment with one of my sweet OR button down tops. Pockets in all the right places, and the zippered leg pocket is big enough for my phone and optimally placed back on the leg to not be cumbersome when hiking or scrambling. 
I can see these being my go-to summer pants.

Given that I bought these for either long day hikes or backpacking, and those activities usually cause pants to stretch considerably after a few hours of wear,  I would say these pants are poorly cut and sized.  I mean, should I really be buying pants that are sized 3-4"" smaller than the tape measure indicates?  What is weird is that I have the Ferrosi Crag pants in medium which is supposed to be a 32"" waist and they fit fine.  Go figure.

No need for venting despite a strenuous climb.  And they are windproof and very water resistant.  We encountered very deep, though dry snow, and these pants kept me dry all day.   I also used them for skiing at Sugarloaf on several warm days, again, with mid-weight base layer, and they were very comfortable, even on the lift and at the summit.  

They are a trim fit, and the cuffs are slender, but they move so well, I liked the trim fit, especially when we were bushwhacking.  I don't think they will resist a lot of moisture (wet snow, or more than a brief shower), but they breath so well, are so wind resistant, and dry quickly, they really are a pretty versatile pant.

-It's difficult and uncomfortable to fit a pack inside the bivvy with you (yes, I understand this very different than a normal tent). Make sure you have something else to protect your bag and gear.

-Spend 20 minutes when it first arrives to figure out how to assemble the bivvy, how to open the mesh screen, storm screen, etc. It's easy once you've' done it a couple times, but it would be very annoying to figure out in the pouring rain!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-04 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Outdoor Research","Advanced Bivy","593224039",5,"have used this bivy many times and have had zero issues with the product. The construction is top notch and I'm not worried about damaging the bivy in the field and I'm extremely hard on gear. This bag might be overkill for summer or even the fall, where one could get by with a lighter, smaller sized bivy, such as the OR Alpine, but for winter camping, overnights, or multi-climbing, this bivy is hard to beat. A couple features that make this bivy ideal for sub-zero winter camping are the following:

* A very generous overall cut, which accommodates high loft sleeping bags. I use mine with a WM Puma -25 bag and still have plenty of room inside. I also use two pads, a Thermarest Prolite Plus size large, situated on top of a small Z-Lite pad for extra warmth on my torso. The two pad setup lifts you off the ground several inches, pushing your head and face closer to the top of the bivy. But with the Advanced Bivy, I still feel like there is ample headroom.

* The integrated foot box vent allows for even greater air circulation, which helps cut down on condensation. I never close this vent and have never had a problem with the elements getting into the bag, or wetting my sleeping bag. 

* The guy points on the top of the bag allow for various stakeout positions depending on conditions. With heavy to moderate snowfall I will stake these out in order to prevent sagging. If you experiment with this you will see that some configurations will give you even more headroom inside, as the tension on the main pole can be controlled given the direction of the guy lines etc. I have guyed this out with one piece of cord from the middle hood loop straight up to a tree branch and that seemed to really provide a lot of strength to the hood area. When doing this it's good to stake out at least 2 of the underside loops on the head side of the bag. I don't usually stake out the loops at the foot of the bag.

Many people find the zippers in this bag difficult to manipulate, but you need to practice using the bag to easily and quickly manipulate opening and closing it, especially in cold weather. I have seen some reviewers erroneously claim you have to unsnap the pole in order to close it tight--this is not true, as the zipper pulls must be passed around the pole fro inside the bag, a relatively simple thing to do. This is the only aspect of the opening and closing of the bag, that can be cumbersome if you haven't practiced doing it. 

Condensation has not been too much of an issue. The times when I had frost form inside the bag in sub zero temps, I was either drying a lot of gear inside the bivy and/or, had the bag fully zipped, which is really not good to do with any bivy. 

One thing I have noticed is that in very cold weather, the shock cord on the poles, becomes limp and looses it's elasticity, which can make putting the pole together a pain. 

For packing purposes I leave the stuff sack the bivy comes with at home, as it is too tight to use in the field in freezing conditions. Instead, I use a 9.0L, medium size ultra-sil stuff sack, which allows me to roll the bivy and poles up and easily get it into the bag. The last thing you want to do when breaking down camp or setting up, is to struggle with stuff sacks. Inside my pack it compresses down anyways, plus the ultra sil is lighter.

For sizing, I'm 6'2","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-02-08 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Outdoor Research","Advanced Bivy","1071241193",5,"I had been on the hunt for a lightweight one-man shelter to take backpacking and motorcycle camping. It has to be fast and easy to setup, no condensation, lightweight, waterproof and durable. I initially bought a Marmont Starlight 1P,  but it was a soggy nightmare to sleep in temperate weather due to the condensation. So my hopes where high for the OR Advanced Bivy.

From the moment you pull this out of the bag, the quality construction and materials are apparent. GoreTex fabric, taped seams, strong zips, coated lining. This is a serious adventure bag.

Now I'm 6'2"", 180lbs. I've got a long Nemo Cosmo Air sleeping pad. It's a big pad and  I was worried it wouldn't fit in the Advanced Bivy with my Marmot Plasma 15 sleeping bag even though it's meant for larger pads. I was wrong, it fits fine, not a problem. The internal elastic straps that hold the pad in place are a little tight, but maybe that's a good thing.

Setting this up is easy with the two lightweight poles and button-pole ends. I think the end clips could lock into the poles to prevent them slipping out during restless nights (you'll see what I mean), but some tape fixed that. The tape also helped me remember which pole goes where as they aren't color coded or anything.

I've heard some people ask how to hold this open. It has a thick wire that runs around the flap edge, you can fold that back on itself and it holds it open. Another technique I use is to jam my Snow Peak SnowMiner Headlamp into the poles in the interior. Keeps the light close and holds the poles open.

The stow bag is a little on the small side, and whilst it is made of the same durable fabric as the base of the bivy,  the closure on the tie-rope is weak and doesn't hold the bag closed. With the 4 small pole ends (plus one spare, nice touch) and poles not having a separate bag, some DIY modifications are needed to confidently attach the stowed bag to the outside of my backpack.

When I contacted OR about this relatively minor feedback, they were fantastic and helped me with some pole ends to modify.

I get the feeling I'll be in one of these bags for the rest of my life to be honest. Just a superb quality product from a reputable brand (I remember snowboarding in their mittens years ago when they were the 'cool' gloves!).

My old rain shell bit the dust after a few years of heavy use, so I decided I wanted to upgrade a little. I needed something to check these boxes:
1. Trim enough to fit a button-down or light fleece and not much else.
2. Packable enough that I won't think twice about bringing it when I travel.
3. Durable enough not to get trashed by backpack straps.
4. Breathable enough that I won't feel like I'm in a sauna when bike commuting.

After searching around and getting a recommendation from Leta, I decided on the Axiom. It's trim enough to look good with just a t-shirt, but has enough room for my Atom LT if needed. It's packable enough to fit in a medium Eagle Creek cube with a base layer or my wife's rain coat without having to force it. I've used it 6 times and the durability seems to be fine. Based on the other reviews, I have nothing to worry about there. Breathability is activity dependent as always, but this jacket surprised me. I can wear it up to 50 while biking before I start sweating like crazy and actually felt chilly standing around at 60 when the wind was blowing, which is very similar to my running jacket which isn't waterproof and has lots of ventilation holes. 

I know it would add some weight, but I'd still like to see pit zips for when I'm super active (bike commuting). The hem isn't tight enough for me to return it, but a little more room would be nice. 

My biggest regret is that when I stopped to help someone change a flat, I casually laid my jacket on my bike, and got some grease on the hood. Totally goofed on that one..

Since I'm sure you'll read this Leta, how would you compare this to the Realm? I didn't know about it until I already bought this and put some grease on it.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-15 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Outdoor Research","Axiom Jacket - Men's","2101585708",5,"I just returned from a month and a half in Patagonia from a trip during a wetter than usual season.  The unsettled weather and rapidly changing conditions meant that I was usually wearing a hard shell, even while approaching and climbing.  During periods of heavy movement, I would wear the OR Ferosi, but then layer up with this on the outside when things got real.  It saved my bacon and turned out to be extremely durable. 
Durability: 
I climbed plenty of technical mixed and ice pitches that put holes in my pack, pants, and other layers, but this thing looks brand new.  I like the larger than normal zipper teeth, which seem more robust than some of those on other jackets. 
Fit:
I went with a large as I usually wear the jacket as my outer-most layer, sometimes even over a midweight down-layer while burning time in cold, snowy conditions.  This fits well for me in the those cases, but I also have broad shoulders. When wearing only over a t-shirt or something, the fit is a tad big. Fits nicely over my helmet without restricting movement and the sleeve length is good for swinging tools. 
Bottom-line:  
Used for what it is meant for (bad weather), this is the shell you want for the price, durability, and fit - though the latter is subjective. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-02-02 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

You can't pack this jacket into it's pocket, this used to be possible, not anymore. The fit is really weird, the older one was also slim fit but the current version is really slim in the hem area compared to shoulders and arms. While the older version seemed to be more of a normal slim fit the current version would be perfect for those with wide shoulders and really long arms, but with a chicken legs, if you size up to have some room around your thighs, the arms are likely to be too long. Old version medium was a perfect fit, current one is just too long in the arms and a little boxy with just about perfect space in the hem around my waist and thighs, if I size down to a small the jacket won't go over my thighs and I'd have to use is above my waist line.

It also had a hem that descended halfway to my knees  and sleeves that extended at least an inch past my fingertips.

The waterproofing and breathability are solid, the stretch in the material is a lifesaver, and it's ultra lightweight, packable design has been great as I keep it in a small pocket of my backpack at all times in case the weather turns and I have to brave a blizzard on my commute home. The only features I wish I had were hand pockets and velcro cuffs which has since been added.

The model I own runs quite small. I usually wear size small (I seriously am a size small in most outdoor brands despite being 180), but this jacket is too snug to comfortably layer under in a small. Also, the jacket is cut with long sleeves and a short body, more like a typical softshell than snowboarding shell. Notably, the 20D material does lend it thin enough it provides no insulation of its own unlike the heavy skiing oriented shell jacket I own.

I wore it over a base layer and under a raincoat on a chilly 35 degree morning, and by the time I got to the top of the first climb (a seven mile climb) I was very surprised that I wasn't feeling too sweaty. I unziped the raincoat on the top to find that the base layer and ferrosi had transported all of my moisture away from my body until it was stopped by the raincoat. The outside of the ferrosi was getting wet, but the inside was wicking unbelievably well. I have never had a jacket like this that was able to move moisture like that. The downfall of the ferrosi is wind resistance. For fast, chilly descents on my bike the ferrosi did not offer as much protection from wind as some other jackets I have used. This is not a downfall, more of a trade-off between breathability and weather resistance. This thing breathes like a baselayer and sheds a light rain and breeze well.  For skiing I expect it will be perfect because I move much slower in the skin track than on my bike, and on the way down I will be putting on an insulating layer underneath or a shell over top. So on the spectrum of breathability and weather protection, this jacket falls squarely on the breathable side, which for me is perfect as I intend to use it for high output activities. The other beautiful thing about this jacket is how small it packs down, not that you'll ever need to put it i your pack.

Very wind and weather resistant. Mild snow and spindrift is of no concern during touring or mountaineering. It's abrasion resistant so you can climb in it, no worries.

DWR can take a beating without wetting out in Utah snow, but PNW heavy rain will devour you in under 10 minutes.

The Ferrosi jacket is by far the best all around lightweight jacket in existence. The feel is comfortable. It carries great warmth for its weight. I wore it while bearing a very windy low to mid 20s MN day in early march waiting outside for an event for over 90 mins. While i was cold  i was not freezing. That was sitting in one spot. I know moving around had I been hiking would have kept me nice and toasty. So sitting immobile for such a period of time in those temperatures with no gloves really spoke volumes to me.

The wind will break through somewhat but not once do you get a shivering chill. There is a nice coolness factor when you turn it up and go hard while wearing it that really is great at regulating body heat.

It also offers great water resistance. Rain beads off nicely and has a great fitted hood that fits your head without adjusting.

It packs down nice and small so its a backpacking dream.

1. You can't just simply pull the gloves off.  The inside liner is not connected to the shell.  If you don't grab the glove completely, you'll pull the inside material inside out when you pull your hand out.
2.  Make sure you treat the outside as the exterior gets wet too fast.

I'll admit it: I have swollen rock climber fingers and that might be the root of the problem. The problem is that while being slightly long for me in the fingers, the gloves are tight girth-wise and sometimes numb out select fingers. They also have bunchy fabric at the ends of the fingers that isn't ideal. I give them four stars because I still like them: they're windproof, minimalist and therefore perfect for aerobic pursuits in temperatures down into the teens. The OR Extra Vert gloves, though insulated, fit my poor, abused hands much better in the same size (medium).  Other more normal hands will probably like the Super Vert better than I do. All gripes aside, these are still my go-to skate skiing gloves in all but the most bitter temperatures.

That makes it less comfortable for slouching around in, but perhaps slightly superior as an outer layer in cold weather.  The wind rips right through the Nano Air so you really need a shell on top when it gets blowy.  My only criticism is that the  Uberlayer feels like it is cut just a little tight around the armpits.

Day 2: Pack as a layer for an evening fly fishing outing. Almost immediately slip on a rock and fall into the river, submerging all worn clothing, and filling waders.

First off, for cold, rainy, Seattle days...this hat is probably perfect.  For me it will be more of a 3 season hat (Spring, Summer, Fall) and it seems a little overbuilt and hot for summer use.  I used to use the Nimbus for kayaking and my head rarely got hot.  Kept the rain off and the sun off.

But, there are two things that make me worry about the Seattle version - 1) it has velcro on the sides instead of snaps.  So, if you don't look in the mirror when you put the sides up they are often mismatched or crooked.  The Nimbus had snaps so you only had one way to put the sides up and it was always perfect.   2) The entire inner hat is lined.  That and Gortex not being nearly as breathable as the folks at Gore would like you to think, it seems like it'll be a sweaty hat to wear on a summer day.  No ventilation options at all.

But, it was the closest thing to my old Nimbus so I bought it.

Seems very well constructed and I have not doubt it is waterproof.

Regarding sizing, I measured my head and the chart says I'm a solid Large.  The large is very big on me.  I have to tighten the inside strap all the way to make the hat comfortably snug.  Plus it looks pretty baggy up top (lots of extra room).   I ordered a M and found that was too snug, but the brim and top were just the right size.  So, I stuck with the large.

I'm feeling this is the best hat I've found but maybe not the best for me.  Or maybe I just miss my Nimbus.

","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-06-04 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Outdoor Research","Mt. Baker Modular Mitten","2843099",5,"First a disclaimer: For any glove, warmth is subjective to the individual, and highly affected by the activity for which they are being used. Plus, one's level of exertion can affect actual and perceived warmth, and result in alternating periods of comfort, chilling, overheating,  sweating,  etc. When holding various gear, insulation compression combined with loss of heat through conduction can also have major impacts. Thus many reviews of gloves are biased by unthoughtful impressions of a bad experience where the user did not consider all of the impacting factors.
With that in mind, I recommend these gloves to be a useful component in a well thought out strategy for keeping ones hands warm in cold winter conditions. I live in the Adirondacks in NY state, and get out into the mountains for (sometimes multi-day) winter hiking, ice climbing, and ski-mountaineering, whenever I am not skiing in northern Vermont. The winters here are brutal, some of the coldest in the country, with temperatures often in double digits below zero, not factoring wind chill. With elevation, temps drop further and winds increase dramatically.  I was out many times this winter on -40F wind chill summits. Then put an ice tool, ski pole, or cold aluminum ice axe shaft into your hand for a few hours, and you will find any pair of gloves seriously tested.   
I've struggled for years to find the right glove combination, but  have found a system that works through the variety of harsh conditions in my local ADK playground...and This OR Mt Baker Modular Mitt is an important part of it!  Another component in my system is TWO pairs of Black Diamond Mid-Weight Glove Liners.  They are made of Polartec Powerstretch fleece, dry fast and go for about $19. The final component is a pair of Hestra Primaloft Extreme Mitt Liners. They're supremely insulating, and can be had for $55 on sale. Final price of the whole system is about $210...pricey, but well worth it, and you will never be wanting in any situation. Thus your last glove purchase, ever. The versatility of this OR mitt is that the insulating glove can be separated out to leave a completely non-insulated seam sealed Gore-tex shell with very durable face fabric. This means that when/if your insulating layer gets sweaty, you can swap it out for a dry layer that gets inserted into a completely dry shell.  Too many other shells incorporate their own integrated insulation that remains behind even after the inner layer is removed, meaning that moisture in the outer shell is something you'll have to live with, and also greatly decreases drying time, which can be critical for multi-day winter endeavors.
The insulating red glove in this OR Mt Baker Mitt has a generous amount of Primaloft on the back of the hand, and when stuffed inside of the shell is a very cozy combo for easy walking on an average winter day (-5F to 20F).  There is no Primaloft  in the palm, so conduction from an axe handle can be an issue.   The grip patches on fingertips afford good dexterity to do most manipulations without exposing hands to severe weather.  
In my system, I will use just the BD liners for mild conditions, or during heavy exertion.  They are surprisingly warm, but the wind goes right through 'em. Solution: throw just the shell over the top to keep the wind out, greatly increasing warmth. Getting colder? Put on just the red OR liner, or red liner plus shell. You get the idea.
Now, when trying these gloves on, I fit comfortably snug in size medium, but I got a large. They're roomy enough to fit the BD liners into the red insulating layer, allowing extra layering combinations, both with and without the outer shell. And also adds a layer of bulk to protect palms from conductive heat loss when holding stuff.  But the real beauty is in managing moisture. When one BD liner gets moist from normal skin transpiration I swap it with the second pair, clip to my backpack, 30 min it's dry.  The Hestra Mitt inserts are the ULTIMATE insulation, and can be used with the shell and BD liners to -40F","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-03-27 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

I wore them on a wicked approach of Eldorado Peak in North Cascades National Park during May. The entire approach was a sufferfest of pouring rain, then hail, and then whiteout conditions up to the Inspiration Glacier. These pants beaded water better than my hardshell OR Foray jacket (which I do not recommend). I don't think any pant could've been a better choice there.

The integrated snow gaiter clips work decently well, but not as well as on the Ferossi Pant, so you might still wait gaiters when in a lot of wet snow.

Best use is in high output activities below 40 degrees in the alpine. The material is tough, breathable, and water resistant.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-09-26 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Outdoor Research","Cirque Softshell Pant - Men's","4867559",5,"These are the best pants on the planet. And I'm not joking. I bought these pants for a 6 week alpine rock climbing trip in The Bugaboos (Canada) and Wind River Range (Wyoming, USA) and they are literally perfect. The fit was the perfect mix of loose and slim giving me uninterrupted freedom of movement but without excess material and bulk which was enhanced by the bi-directional stretch material. The were warm enough while climbing in 3C degree temperatures and not too hot when hiking up glaciers in the sun when it was 15 - 20C. The ankle gussets meant that I can pull the pants in while climbing but there is easily room for the pants to fit over plastic boots. The material is stretchy, water resistant, quick drying and tough. I spent 6 weeks dragging my arse up hundreds of metres of finger and hand ripping course granite crack routes and was regularly burying my legs and ankles into the cracks. Despite this punishment the ONLY visible damage was done after spending 20 hours on a 800 route with a chap stick in my thigh pocket, and even then it's only some minor abrasion. At this rate in 30 years time when I've torn a few holes in these pants I'll definitely be straight back to buy another pair. Next time I'll get the black pair though. I'm not such a huge fan of the grey. Buy these pants! You won't regret it!
Actually one improvement would be larger pockets. I guess you need to balance between slim line and practical, but it would be useful if the pockets were a bit larger (especially if the openings were a bit larger) but I'm really being pedantic here. The pockets fit my wallet, phone and keys so really it's fine.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-08-19 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Outdoor Research","Cirque Softshell Pant - Men's","2099508171",3,"Baseline, these pants and fabric perform very well. Wind and snow protection is great as well as warmth and breathability. However, I also found numerous drawbacks.
1) pockets are tiny and are fairly useless when compared to the fit of the pant. Items budge out and press hard against legs. The front pockets fits my iphone 5 (aka my GPS) or my tracker 3, but they are a very tight fit and cause lots of sweating.
2) relatively heavy for performance: get rid of belt loops, streamline velcro/belt system, lighten crampon protection, and remove rear pocket.
2a) also the velcro tightening system happens to be right where hip straps rests, could be adjusted or redesigned for more comfort.
3) gaiter system does not work all that well unless you have large boots that completely fill the pant leg (e.g. ski boots).","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-07-24 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

As others have mentioned the front pockets are a little small but it doesn't bother me because all I use them for are small snacks or my car keys.  The pockets are warm if your hands fit in them though.  I am guessing but I don't think OR designed the pockets to be used as alternates to gloves.  The hook on the front of the cuff of the pants works well in light snow but extended use in deep snow will eventually let snow into your boots.  I recommend using gaiters if you will be plodding through a lot of snow.  I attached a video of a recent trip where I was wearing these pants.  I paired them with a pair of OR sequence tights and I never got too hot when climbing or too cold when taking breaks.  The temps hovered around 32F with lots of sun.

"Outdoor Research","Cirque Softshell Pant - Men's","699328551",4,"Picked these up for the alpine climbing season. I haven't yet climbed with them, but I have taken them out for a bunch of mountain activities: ice axe / glissade practice up on Rainier in a 50 degree scorcher, dry, rocky scrambling up Putrid Pete's Peak, bushwacking off trail going vertical on a sopping wet Snoqulamie Mountain winter scramble, and alpine start practice in the pre-dawn cold out on the ski slopes. These pants have handled it all, and handled it well while keeping me warm, cool, and dry. While bushwacking, I banged my shin against a sharp branch on a blowdown - pants didn't get damaged, even though my leg was bleeding under the pants (wat). While glissading down several ~100 ft chutes, only a small part of my behind got wet, mostly because I left the back pocket slightly open. I can't wait to wear these on alpine climbs.

I gotta second the other reviewers on the fit and pocket size. I'm tall and thin and wear a 32x32 pant. Medium fits great in the waist and the inseam length is just about perfect for mountaineering boots. However, the thigh area is fairly tight. I don't think I have particularly large upper legs either. The small pocket size is made worse because of how tight the upper legs are - there's practically no room between my leg and the pant fabric to put anything in the upper pockets. The pocket on the lower thigh is a bit more useful, but there's no way you're fitting a map in there (like a Green Trails map) unless you fold it 8 times.

Near the top of Davis Peak, we were getting hit with typical spring mountain weather: one moment, it's 45 degrees and sunny, the next, the skies darken, wind kicks up, and the snow starts coming down. The cirque pants kept it real.

My only complaint is about the front pockets. Are these pockets for ants? Really only big enough for holding your car keys or maybe a small wallet. The leg and back pocket are both sized for real life, so that's good.

UPDATE: Wore these pants up Saint Helens over the weekend. Perfect weather. They blocked the wind and breathed enough to keep me from over heating. I put shell pants on for glissading down. When I took those shells off, there was still a bit of downhill, but glissade time was mostly over. I did do some semi-accidental glissading on these pants and after a few times my butt was wet.

I'm 5.9"", 185. I am sometimes between a medium and a large although most of my jackets are large.

Firstly, the fit for this jacket is listed as trim but I found the large to be very large on me. I think a medium might have worked better although I'll keep the large so that I can layer more underneath. This is not a thick puffy. Others say this runs small so clearly your mileage may vary, but I have a couple of OR base layer shirts and those too run really large. I've found their button-down shirts to be the same.

Secondly, the fabric is Pertex Shield+. I suspected that would mean a very shiny jacket and it is. I got mine in Hydro/Abyss (blue) and from many pictures you see online it doesn't look shiny at all. I'm OK with it, just FYI.

Thirdly, the Pertex fabric is a little ""crinkly"". Not as loud as some Gore-Tex jackets but definitely not silent like a Patagonia Down Sweater. It's not a big deal.

The key feature of this jacket is that it's waterproof (as the industry calls it) by having the Pertex Shield fabric and NOT puncturing it. There are no stitches through the fabric for the baffles.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-01-25 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

Waterproof would be nice as we get freezing rain too.  The jacket is very thin, like an inch thick. I was wanting more bulk when I had ordered. I first wore Floodlight with a short sleeve shirt under it on a windy +30F day, and it wasn't enough.  What I learned was this is a great jacket for layering. With a fleece sweater under it, it's warm down to nearly zero if there isn't a lot of wind.  I haven't had a chance to test waterproofness, but it looks like it will be OK in freezing rain but maybe not a down pour.  The zipper is pretty exposed. The hood is very nice, and the large pockets are outstanding.  It's a slim cut and fits a bit tight. At first I was disappointed with it, but the more I wore it the more I came to appreciate it, especially with a warm base layer.  It's lightweight and works for me.  I give it four stars because in high wind at 22F degrees, it doesn't hold heat quite as well as I wanted.  Excellent for layering, very well designed.

Function
I use these gloves primarily skiing when I am really working. Wearing just the fleece inner liner while on the boot pack to some powder stashes at the ski resort or on the skin track for hours on end they do a good job at keeping my hands warm but wicking away all the sweat.  I have used the shell only once. It wasn't a terribly cold day but the wind was whipping pretty strong on the hike up. My hands were getting cold with only the inner liner so I put on the outer shell and that was enough to stay warm, I kept them on for the ski down and they did fine for that also.  As far as dexterity goes they do pretty well despite the fact that the fingers a little long. Its hard to tell if the little rubber grippy dots actually do anything or not but I had no trouble griping my poles or anything else. I can actually use the touch screen on my phone if I'm only wearing the inner liners. 

Fit 
 I got a large because that seams to always work for me in gloves. When I first tried them on I realized that the fingers were a bit to long. I tried on the next size down in a local store that carried them and they were too small so I decided to keep the Large. It just seams to me that the fingers are oddly long on the thumb, index and middle finger. 

Value 
$52 is no pocket change by any means. I feel that they are worth the money even though they are a light glove they are pretty versatile.  They have a very quality feel and I don't think they will let me down.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-01-07 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

No trouble moving in them. Only ding I give them is for the front pockets. Weird angle, to get hands in them you have to come in from the front and straight down. But I didn't loose anything I put in them so I can't complain too much.

I bought these in 34, but also tried on the 32s. The 32s fit but were a bit snug. 34s are quite a bit looser and sit lower on my waist but I've got room to add a layer underneath if needed.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-09-18 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

I was looking for a convertible pant that was comfortable, stretchy, wind and water resistant, but most important breathes well. And the Ferrosi series nails it! 
This summer I have worn these pants for backpacking and for long international travel / flights. 
Strengths: Breathability. I am a sweaty beast, and any material that is actually waterproof is too sticky for me to wear next to skin. The comfort of the ferrosi line is amazing.
Weaknesses: Not waterproof. If you are looking for a waterproof softshell then this is not the pant for you.

Fit: I normally wear a 31"" waist in jeans and the 32"" Regular fit slightly loose and perfect with a belt. The shorts zip off to just above my knee, and I do not notice any discomfort from the zipper while hiking. They are perhaps a little long, but fall nicely over a pair of hiking boots or shoes.

"Outdoor Research","Ferrosi Convertible Pant - Men's","874498",5,"As I prepared for a trip to the Wind River Mtns this September, the one thing I needed was a good pair of durable, comfortable convertible pants. I decided to go with the Outdoor Research Ferrosi Pants even though the review wasn't that favorable. I was super happy that these were the pants I chose. I couldn't be happier with how they performed, how quick they dried, how comfortable they were, and that they show zero signs of wear even though I bushwhacked for 30 miles.

The two things I had questions about was the placement of the zipper (which also determines the length of the shorts) and that these pants don't have a 'boot' zipper to allow easy removal of the lower legs when zipped off for shorts. In my experience both of these are non-issues. I really liked the length of the short (a bit longer than others I tried) and I never experienced any discomfort after hiking 30+ miles in some seriously difficult terrain from the zipper rubbing against my knee. The zipped off portion of the pant were easy to remove due to the stretchy nature of the material.

My overall impressions is very good! They pants are much more durable than the average taslin nylon backpacking pants, the stretch allows for much more freedom of movement, and I even liked the front pockets which, in my opinion, were designed to be easily accessible while wearing a hip belt. I liked the side pocket's vertical zipper as I used this to access my iPhone for pictures along the way.

"Outdoor Research","Helium HD Jacket - Men's","1190489",1,"First of all, OR products have been favorites of mine for years. 

I was impressed with the build quality and weight when the jacket arrived. The fit was decent, a little long in the torso, but overall, not bad. Nice pitzips, welded zippers and hood adjustments. Every feature you could want in a jacket. The reason for buying this was to use on bikepacking / backpacking / canoeing trips. Wanted a lightweight rain jacket that could perform in active scenarios. Recent reviews of this jacket and others using the Pertex Shield+ have been positive so I was excited about the Helium HD.

Last weekend a friend and I embarked on a bikepacking trip over 3 days. Knowing the forecast of storms for the last day of our trip I was excited to put this jacket to the test while riding 60 miles through the rain. I don't know how else to say this. but the jacket failed miserably. I could have worn a garbage bag and had similar performance. Still trying to figure it out, but this jacket is either 0% breathable or 0% waterproof. I'm assuming the breathability is the issue. I was completely soaked from neck to waist. The rain wasn't a torrential downpour, but steady for the first couple of hours. I actually had to stop to change my base layers and jacket to keep from succumbing to hypothermia. It's was 36 degrees and the second I stopped the chill set in. To market this as a breathable rain shell is just irresponsible. I put on my convertible Sugoi windbreaker and I was better off in that the rest of the ride home. For this particular use, this jacket was such a disappointment and will be shipping back to backcountry.com immediately. Such a letdown and the search for a waterproof AND breathable jacket continues. 

If you're doing any of the following activities in the rain, this is not the jacket for you:

Running
Cycling
Paddling
Hiking
Rollerblading
Wrestling
Obstacle Coursing
Pretty much anything active.


This may be the jacket for some people and activities like:

Sitting in the rain
Standing in the rain
Cooking in the rain
Hanging from a repel line in the rain
Yoga in the rain
Meditation in the rain
Knitting in the rain
Driving a convertible in the rain
Etc.
 
If you're doing any of the above activities, you should just save your money and buy an entry level rain jacket for half the price, they perform the same way as the Helium HD.

Sorry OR, everything else I have from you has been awesome, but this is irresponsibly marketed as Waterproof and Breathable. This is simply not true. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-04-25 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Outdoor Research","Helium HD Jacket - Men's","100851868",5,"OR's Helium HD finally topped my list after I searched for over a year for the right lightweight rain jacket to use year around, and particularly for those late summer thunderstorms when you're hiking in 100F one minute and looking for shelter the next. It is exceptionally lightweight, breathable, pack-able, and comfortable. It packs so small and light that I'll often clip it to my shorts and forget it is there. It disappears into a pack's side bottle pocket.

The fit is spot on for me. I'm 6'3"" and currently (unfortunately) 230lbs, 36"" waist, athletic with a little extra. The XL fits how I prefer- feeling tailored but not fitted, falling just below the hips with sleeves coming mid-finger in a way that keeps other layers nice and dry. I like how the hood has one back cinch that actually draws it around my narrow head and whose cord rests above my ears. It's easily adjustable to fit snugly over a cap or climbing helmet, which I had no problem fitting into the hood. Side cords pull the hood close to the face and seal the deal. The wire brim crams down well and always returns to form when unpacked. Pit zips help to keep the heat and moisture out as well as they can. I like having the two zippers per vent to allow fully open or managed venting as necessary.

In the rain, water beads and is easily shaken off. During casual use, nary a drop has been let in when the hatches are battened. I have to remember that this is not a shell and I shouldn't expect it to be impenetrable. Climbing and on belay for four hours during steady mist and light rain, water stayed out and my shirt never got wet. On the hike down, I had a pack and rope tied around my shoulders. At some point, the hood (over a hat), shoulders, and spots on the chest accumulated water on the inside. I don't know if it was from the fabric wetting out or from my own sweat being unable to evaporate in the humid and soaking conditions. Either way, it performed much better than any other lightweight rain jacket ever has. I tend to run hot and sweat easily, making most jackets pointless after a few minutes of active use. Even though I could feel quite a bit of moisture with my hands, my shirt and hat never wetted out oddly enough. When taken off under cover, the jacket dried quickly. I'm comfortable knowing this jacket will keep me dry long enough to get a few more miles in and set up shelter before I'm in trouble.

I haven't tested the durability. The fabric is definitely thin, but it doesn't cause the anxiety of thin fabrics I've experienced on down products. It's handled brushes with brush, but I try not to scrape it on anything sharp. A little fabric side note is that it's loud, but not deafening and crinkly like some other jackets.

Overall, the Helium HD checked every box I needed and I would recommend to others. The black and blue look sharp and I don't mind wearing it wherever I go.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-04-19 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Outdoor Research","Helium HD Jacket - Men's","1703594195",4,"I grabbed this jacket as a lightweight shell for ski touring.  I was worried that I would be sacrificing too much by giving up waterproofness for breathability with softshells or wind shells so I settled on this minimal waterproof shell.  It is a fully featured jacket for less than 10 oz which is about as light as they come.  This jacket has great venting between the pit zips and the mesh hand pockets so that it never turned too muggy inside. I got the jacket at the start of the season and have worn it skiing in the Sierras and the Tetons.   It kept out the weather in very wet, windy conditions, and did a good job for blocking the wind on ridges and summits.  It also packs down incredibly small in its chest pocket so I have no worries about tossing it into my pack.  Though the jacket has worked well so far I do have some minor issues:
-The waist is too tight compared with the rest of the torso (I only noticed this around town and not too much while skinning/skiing)
-The hood is supposedly helmet compatible but it was a very tight fit and definitely restricted my motion.  I left the hood off whenever I was wearing a helmet as a result but it would work in an emergency.
-Durability: The jacket held up surprisingly well while skiing and dealt with branches, trees, and rocks. I am more worried about the effects of packing the jacket into the chest pocket repeatedly.. It seems like it definitely stresses some of those seams and I could see it ripping eventually.  I guess we will see.

Overall I would definitely recommend this jacket if you want something lightweight and with plenty of features as long as  you are willing to deal with some helmet hood comfort issues.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-03-15 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Outdoor Research","Helium HD Jacket - Men's","2111839716",4,"The Helium jacket has changed the way I pack because it pretty much always comes with me. I use it for sun, wind, and water protection; it does all of them pretty well. When the jacket is smaller and weighs less than 3 Clif Bars, it's easy to toss in your pack (or pocket) and rely on it. 



Personally, I use this jacket when I expect wind, sun, or light water at temperatures above 40 and below 70. That's not to say it won't perform at different temperatures, but I've found it a little too clammy for warmer temps or high aerobic activities. 



When climbing, this guy easily clips on to my harness and is *perfect* for multi-pitch belays. When hiking up to a peak, again, the perfect piece for protection during a summit lunch. I also toss this in my mountain bike pack in case of drizzles and light rain. 



Fit is great on this piece. At 6ft and 170 lbs the Medium fits well over light layers or just a t-shirt. For such a ""minimalist"" jacket, the hood is very well designed. It's easy to adjust and pretty good visibility. 



Only thing to be aware of is that this isn't meant as a ""daily-use"" shell. So it isn't the most durable or feature rich shell around; but it can't be beat for lightweight and packable protection. The HD adds pitzips as well as hand pockets and a redesigned hood cinch.

"Outdoor Research","Helium HD Jacket - Men's","105245470",5,"This jacket is hands down, amazing. I would recommend anyone looking for a lightweight, packable (and good looking) shell to give the Helium HD a try. I promise you won't be disappointed. Here are a few reasons why I think everyone should have this in their pack for when the wet stuff falls. 

Material: The first thing you notice with this shell is that, well, it doesn't FEEL like a shell. When I think shell, I think of a garment that is loud, crinkly, and a little bit ""stiff"". The Helium HD isn't any of those. Here is a description of what it is: movable, comfortable, durable. Waterproof, breathable, clutch. Keep in mind, this wouldn't be ideal for walking through briars or adventuring through a haunted forest on the regular, but for everything else, this is solid. Utilizing 30D ripstop fabric with Pertex Shield +(2.5 layer), it holds up to the intense rainstorms we experience here in the Wasatch, keeping you bone dry as well as allowing you to breathe once the rain lets off and the sun comes back out. Mine has a few scratches, due to my cat jumping up and attempting to try it on (even your animals want it). Other than that, it has held up to normal daily abuse, as well as multiple camping trips and hikes without issues such as tearing, leaking, or tape coming off of the seams. 

Fit: OR claims that the Helium HD is a ""standard"" fit, and I would agree with them. I am 6ft tall, 200lbs, and wear a size Large (in the Black/Hydro which is killer in the looks department). It fits well enough to be worn by itself and not look baggy or long, and when the temps drop and you need a little extra to keep warm (and no one is around to cuddle with), throw on that down jacket or sweater underneath, and it'll be prime time to continue that adventure. 

Features: This jacket, even though being weighed in ounces (9.1 in the size Large), has all the bells and whistles. How light is 9.1 ounces you ask? If it was any lighter you would need to keep it locked up to make sure it didn't float away. Need to wear some gloves? No problem. Your cuffs have Velcro that allows you to adjust the fit whether they are smaller like belay gloves, or more bulky like a pair of mittens when you're shredding at the resort on that bluebird pow day. The hem cinch is awesome, allowing you to find that perfect resting place on your hips without your jacket riding up with every arm movement. The pit zips are nicely sized, and allows for airing out on a warmer day, regardless of what adventure you're pursuing. Did I mention that the taped seams don't even THINK about letting water in? Think of them as your own personal security against precipitation. The hood isn't just adjustable and helmet compatible, it provides you with your own private awning to enjoy the view as the rain falls by use of a Halo wire brim. Tired of the days that the rain would fall into your face, even with your hood on? Tire no more my friend. Salvation is here. The zippered pockets (harness compatible, which is awesome if you're a climbing goon like myself) are HUGE , and the Napoleon pocket doubles as a stuff pocket for the whole jacket, packing down to the size of an orange. Yes, an orange, as in orange juice, orange creamsicle, and the size that this jacket is once stuffed in its own pocket. 

I think if you have read this far, you have realized that you don't just want this jacket, but that you NEED this jacket in your life. This jacket is a jack of all trades, and will only increase your love for the outdoors due to it allowing you to always be outside, regardless of the weather.

I'm going to echo Christopher P. in saying these pants are WAY too short. I ordered 32"" inseam and wore them a couple of times, thinking each time, ""these are high waters. These Don't even cover my ankles. They BARELY come down to the tops of my boots.""

So I decided to measure the inseam. 29 inches. Cmon, OR. I expected better from you guys. 29 inches isn't even CLOSE to 32 inches.

The non-zippered) front pockets are a bit too shallow for me to trust that anything I put in them wouldn't fall/bounce out, the zippered  rear pocket is also a bit shallow, and the zippered thigh pocket seems a bit too deep, to the point where heavier things placed in it bounce around a bit with every step.

Like, the hem fell at the hipbone, and the sleeves were exactly the right length, which almost never happens.

Maybe a small would have suited me better. 

I also have a giant skull, and a lot of hair that I usually wear in braids wrapped around my head, so the hood--although supposedly suitable to accommodate a climbing helmet--wasn't quite capacious enough for me.

Pros:
- The merino is quite nice, it's soft and pretty warm for its weight.
- Touch fabric is knitted onto the finger*tip*, not just the fingerpad.  When it's just the fingerpad, using the on-screen phone keyboard is nearly impossible.

Cons:
- The gloves are really thin.  As in, I can see my skin color through the knit.
- No grippy stuff on the palms or anything, so they are slippery on a steering wheel, your phone, etc.
- Durability seems really bad.  I've had them for two weeks and already I've got some major pulled threads in the fingertips; the OR logo on one of the gloves is peeling off the back; and when I reached in my pocket to grab my car keys a key actually pierced through a hole in the notch between index and ring finger.  

Neutral
- My pair (bought direct from OR) didn't have the little black clip to attach them together.  It makes them more stylish but easier to lose I guess.

"Outdoor Research","Lucent Heated Glove","109178449",4,"First pair had one defective battery, so I had to replace - in short, a nicely made glove that does indeed provide additional warmth but may need some help in biting temps. I am just finishing a week of skiing in Colorado where temps where at times below zero F.  On brutal days, I needed hand warmers along with gloves running on ""High""; when temps were above 18-20 F, gloves alone were fine. So net/net, while helpful, the gloves alone may not suffice in very cold weather. 

Additional comments:

1) Fit was very good - comfortable and high on the cuff
2) Slim profile on batteries much better than some other chunky batteries I had tried in which I was very aware of little bricks on my wrists - not so here.
2) Power indicators easy to read/use, but -
      a) would be great to have a battery level indicator - perhaps illuminate just the 'O' or ""R"" when below 50% ?
      b) I found my power levels changing when I was unaware - not difficult to make contact with the button inadvertently, so perhaps a second button or switch when changing levels would eliminate unwanted changes.
    c) Would be great if a USB connector could be used - so many places have USB inputs on lamps etc which would allow one to simply bring a cable versus the power connector. Not to mention minimizing impact if one loses the original....
   d) would also be helpful to have a more powerful heating element nearer to the fingertips as opposed to the rest of the hand.

Again, overall, a good product - while I would not accuse these gloves of being wildly inexpensive, they do provide help, and I found myself focused more on my freezing face (even with mask) as opposed to cold fingers. 

I would recommend this product

They're as warm and waterproof as a premium pair of goretex gloves should be expected to be.  All day in the snow?  No problem, whether the snow is dry or wet.  As gloves, they're really nice gloves.

And then you turn on the power.

With the power on, they're life-changing.  There are 3 settings.  On the low setting, battery life is over 9 hours (that was the limit of my patience, not the batteries).  On low, you don't notice the heat.  You don't really notice your hands.  It's just that your hands never get cold.  On high, battery life is around 3 hours...and the gloves are palpably warm inside.  It's amazing.  I haven't tried the medium setting for duration yet.

We haven't had super cold temps yet; I've worn them down to 0 degrees...but nothing colder.  They've been great (on low) at those temps.  They're completely windproof and waterproof.

When you insert the battery pack, make sure that it's all the way plugged in.  That's the only issue I've had--a loose connection caused by my failure to fully plug in.  Charging is quick and easy--a couple hours to a full charge (and it charges both batteries at once).

I picked up a spare set of batteries, and recommend it.  You can have a good, long day of coverage with some high and some low.  You can take the gloves off, your hands get cold, you put the gloves back on, and instant warmth.

These gaiters do not reach the knee, which I don't mind. The velcro up the front keeps the gaiter from slipping down, even when the top clip is undone, and I'm glad to keep more of my leg ventilated. When I'd finish each day, the portion of pants under my gaiter was always sweaty! 

My annoyance was with the clip for laces as my hiking shoes had a center tie on the top laces and I had to put the clip off-center on the shoe. This made the clip less secure, and I usually had to adjust it 2-3 times each day to keep it in place.

"Outdoor Research","Alti Gore-Tex Glove","109379760",5,"I didn't buy these from backcountry, but I thought I would post my review as I bought these up here in Canada from a local store. I bought a size XL, and the fit at first just didn't seem right, kind of like the previous review. However, after using them a few times they seemed to fit much better. I'm not sure why that is. But. what  I can say is they are very, very warm. Like most winter gear, they are warmest when you are active and moving your hands. I've used them when the temp gets down to -25C, with no problem. Even better, if I am doing work like shovelling snow or even just running the snowblower, they have been very warm. The dexterity is not the greatest, but by comparison, most of the gloves I have with high dexterity are significantly less warm. When I go outside, and if keeping my hands warm is the priority, I'll choose my Alti gloves. For reference, I have a pair of North Face Vengeance, and a pair of Arcteryx Betas with the liners (2016s) and the OR Altis are the warmest. Another feature I like is the gauntlets are large and I can get the sleeves of my jacket under the gauntlet, even when wearing both gloves on when it's always harder to tuck the second sleeve in after you've put both gloves on. Some gloves, this is very difficult because of the combination of dexterity and size of the gauntlet. At the price these are being offered, they are an excellent glove for the really cold days. For warmer days (temperatures above -10C) these gloves may even be too warm. When I first got them, I thought I might return them because of the fitment I mentioned earlier, but after trying ""to get along"" with them a few more times I am really happy I kept them. best glove I have ever bought. I can't speak to their water resistance because here in Calgary, we don't really see much in the way moist conditions, but they are Goretex, and are very well put together, so I'm pretty confident in their ability to stay dry if the need ever arises.

I'm right in between Med and Large for most tops and it really depends on the cut.  I ended up getting a Large and am pretty sure that's the way to go.

The ""slim"" fit of this feels like it's mostly in the chest.  The lower half of this is sort of billowy/baggy.  Yes, there's a drawstring to cinch it but I don't find that necessary.  My L is pretty form-fitting but still has some space around the stomach area....not a ton that it would blow in the breeze or look bad.  I'm just saying it's not AS slim as in the upper body.  Frankly, it looks and feels fine.  A Medium would likely have been very very form fitting.  A Large is snug but has enough room to wear something thin underneath it.  Point is, if you are in between sizes, you'd probably do well to pick the larger size.

It's surprisingly warm for how thin it is and seems to be very efficient at keeping accumulated sweat buildup at bay. I do think the material could be ever so slightly thicker on the sleeves to match the insulation over the core.

 My main issue is with how thin the outermost material is. Though  very windproof and warm for its weight, I managed to make two small tears in the fabric after using the hoody outside only a few times. Outdoor Research offered to honor their lifetime warranty and send me a new one, which was helpful, but if your main applications involve bushwhacking, chimney-ing, or otherwise thrashing your gear you might want to look elsewhere.

If you're looking for a warm, lightweight mid-layer for any sort of active application that has you sweating and doesn't normally tear through your clothing, this is a good choice.

EDIT: After using this piece for almost a full year I'm looking in to buying my second (and possibly third). Though the face material is a bit fragile the insulation tends to hold up well in the wash so my small tears have not rendered the layer useless.

This jacket is PERFECT for long, cold approaches so as to keep me from being sweaty and gross and cold when I arrive at the cliff (or boulder, I generally use it for climbing). I couldn't find my cycling base layers one cold morning and used the Deviator instead and was floored by how well it worked. Perfect insulation, breathability, and some windstopper up front. Though Leta has said this is not intended as a base layer it is what I use it primarily for, and I love it.

Other outdoor clothing companies need to take note and make something in this same category. For now, OR has the market cornered. Leta's response should be a good indication of how well this company will take care of you.

"Outdoor Research","Trailbreaker Softshell Pant - Men's","110199637",5,"This is another fantastic pair of pants from OR. I am the proud owner of the Blackpowder pants, and think they are the greatest inbound ski pants of all time, and these may be the greatest backcountry pants. The upper fabric is incredibly breathable, and for all of us sweat-hogs, OR has graced us with HUGE 15 inch side zips to dump heat. I know nobody cares, but I tele. One of my favorite features of these pants is the waterproof lower leg. In the front of the pants the waterproofing goes over the knee, while in the back it just goes to the top of your ski boot, allowing the area behind your knee to breathe. I think of this as a built in gaiter. It keeps my pants from becoming saturated on my shin and adds a layer of durability when I am dropping my knee into fresh powder. True to their name, these pants also rock for breaking trail (which I find myself doing often, since my friends cant keep up with my high speed super quads).  The suspenders rock, but are easily removable. There are side cinches to make adjustments so you do not need a belt with these pants.  

Some downsides to this pant that are really just a personal problem:

The fit of these pants is MUCH slimmer than the fit of the Blackpowder pants. The medium on those is almost too big on me, and the medium on these pants, well, lets just say that even Kim K would be jealous. This might just be because of those high speed super quads I mentioned before (telemark will do that to ya), but who knows. I don't mind the look and feel, in fact I might wear these out on the town to see if I can get a date, however when keeping my Arva Neo in the built in beacon pocket, it stretches the front of the pants a little tighter than I'd like. This is the reason for the title of my review. When you are carrying your beacon in the pocket of these pants, it is quite obvious to any onlookers.  The beacon pocket is one of my favorite features of the blackpowder pants, and I hope these pants bag out a little bit over time so the beacon carry gets a bit more comfortable.

The only other knock on these that nobody will care about are the kneepad pockets. My blackpowder pants have awesome kneepad pockets that accommodate Black Diamond Telekenisis knee pads. The knee pad pockets on these pants are designed to put little squares of foam in, not a full blown kneepad. That foam isn't going to do much for me when I drop my knee into a stump, however it will keep my knees warm and prevent more ligament damage than I already have, which is nice.

Overall these pants are the best touring pants I have ever used, and I find it difficult to reccommend any other pants knowing that these exist. ","EMPLOYEE","2017-11-26 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Outdoor Research","Trailbreaker Softshell Pant - Men's","110199651",5,"My first thought when wearing these pants for the first time was wow these are so comfortable! There's a small amount of spandex added in to provide enough stretch for taking long strides while skinning. I have only used them several times but I can tell the outer shell is very durable and water resistant.  The suspenders are removable if that's not your thing, but I doubt you will be removing them because they are very functional and comfortable. I hate wearing a belt while touring and the suspenders get the job done and I don't even notice them. 
The vents are sealed and fully water proofed when zipped closed. With dual zippers you can vent the pant higher up your leg and dump a lot of heat quickly. I like that there's no mesh in the vent, so it's very quick and easy to regulate body temp, and no extra material to get stuck in the teeth.
There's just enough pockets to hold the essentials while touring without being cumbersome. The beacon pocket is an extra chamber sewn into the right hip pocket. I can see this being useful for some, but personally I like to store my phone there and it works great for that. I'll keep my beacon in the harness. 
The OR Trailbreaker seems more durable than other Gore Tex 3 layer pants I've owned, and they are definitely more comfortable. If you are looking to get a solid touring pant at a good price, this is the answer!","EMPLOYEE","2017-11-15 00:00:00","I've used it several times","true"

Note: at least when I bought these, there was no mesh of any kind under the vent zips, so you'll be...exposed...when unzipping.

Not sure if this is a pro or a con, but they have little guessets at the ankles you can supposedly use to turn the pants into gators. They're so small though, that I gave up trying to figure out how to do that. Nifty idea though.

They stay dry in deep powder yet somehow still manage to be incredibly breathable. Even while going all out on the skin track I struggle to sweat out in them.

They’ve made some good improvements on the side zippers to dump excess heat. The zips are longer than many competitors, don’t have the mesh getting in the way and collecting snow, and so far have done a great job of not unzipping further when you’re active and have them partially unzipped. There’s lots of deep, zippered pockets—I guess it would make more sense to put the beacon clip on a different pocket than the front one since it would get in the way at times, but I don’t keep my beacon in my pants pockets anyway.

Whether I am kneeling down to snap up those foolish heel bails, dropping my knee into bottomless powder, or tomahawking down the slope, my resort shells see more contact with the snow than the average skier's. I need a durable pant, and I have found it here in the Blackpowder pant.  The 200D face fabric is more than capable of standing up to season after season of hard use, whether by a ski patroller, liftie, or  reckless freeheeler.  The pertex shield has kept me dry in many  wet new england days, and the huge thigh vents (both inner and outer) keep me cool  on those long, thigh-burning bump runs, as well as on the occasional bootpack or short tour. Suspenders keep the generous fit up around my waist, and I now much prefer them over a belt for anything ski related. One of my favorite features are the integrated kneepad sleeves. The black diamond telekenesis kneepads fit beautifully, and I just leave them in the pants and forget they are even there. Gone are the days of fiddling with straps that cut off your circulation. Scuff guards add to the durability, while a recco reflector and beacon pocket add some safety.  All of this at a price point that is easy to swallow for a poor telemark skier.

Used for both backcountry touring and DH skiing in temps from minus 10 to 30 F.  Was worried they might be too burly and hot for highly aerobic activity but, no... With the dual vents in the thighs and crotch, I'm never too hot in these pants.  

They've held up durability-wise despite what seems to be lack of a reinforced knee - mentioned elsewhere.  I've lost count of how many times I've used these pants, and are still in one piece, so don't be overly concerned about the knee issue.

Fit is perfect and is what I'd call an athletic fit.  Waist is snug and truely a 32 if not a bit smaller, and pants are fuller in th thighs.  This is a rarity these days when seems all other pants have an oversized waist and are too tight in the thighs and elsewhere.  I don't dig having to overly snug up my belt, and bunch up the waistline, just to keep the pants from falling down on long treks.  I hope this newer model keeps the same snug waistline.

The length is good for me but I've got very long legs, but do think these would still work for people with a regular inseam.

All pockets and zippers work great.

Hope they didn't change the new model too much as I'm ready to buy a backup pair.

Super comfortable.  So much so I forget to take them off when I get home.

Wish the gaitors had a small attachment point to attach and run a cord under a smaller leather ski boot to hold them down.  While the elastic stretch band works great on a full plastic ski boot, they don't grip a thinner boot (like a 3 pin leather Asolo) tightly enough to stay put.  No big deal though, as it's an easy fix to sew loops onto the gators yourself.

That said, I'm keeping the pants because they still seem quite burly and they fit really well.  

Fit: I'm 6'2"" / 185 and wear a 34/34 in jeans (maybe getting closer to a 35 in the waist, but just don't want to admit it).  I bought the Large.  The waist and length are perfect -- maybe even a tad on the long side, but not enough that they go below my boot.  

These are on the baggy side of the spectrum, but sit high on the waist, so they come off more as baggy work pants rather than saggy-skater pants.

They're lightly insulated (very thin brushed fleese on the inside). They have vents on the inner and outer thigh to dump heat.  On super cold days, there's plenty of room for layering. 

The material seems very tough and is quiet when moved.  Being quiet is important to me, because I can't stand the ""crackling"" sound some ski pants make.  There's no range of motion issues.

All the pockets are in the right place (two hip pockets that are oriented vertically, one butt pocket, and one thigh pocket).

There was one model that had the double layer + membrane design, but touchscreen tips were dismal. 

The touchscreen usability is tops. Sensor tips cover a good portion of both pads and tips of fingers - this is important, as some of the gloves had conductive material only at the tips, which renders them useless for many common ways of holding your phone (ie, one-handed, with the side of your thumb doing the tapping). Also, the thumb and index finger pads aren't bulky with too many extra material. The tighter the cut around these fingertips, the more of the screen you can see underneath.

"Outdoor Research","Rangefinder 25-70L Duffel","108786933",4,"The Good:
-Impressive build quality
-Sleek, attractive look; works well for business and leisure travel
-Adjustable straps
-Super lightweight (noticeably lighter than my other duffels)
-Robust and water-resistant; feels indestructible

The Bad:
-Somehow more cramped than another duffel I have of similar size but different dimensions (Everlane Weekender) -- perhaps because material does not give or stretch as much.
-Opening is narrow, making it hard to pack/unpack/access contents
-Straps did not feel stable when wearing as a backpack; wanted to constantly slip off shoulders (could experiment with tightness to possibly mitigate; I am thin and tall, by way of reference)

Summary:
I am a frequent traveler and as such have become a duffel-bag enthusiast (fetishist?). For a light packer I find that they offer the perfect balance of form factor, weight and portability. I love to throw a well-made duffel over a shoulder to dash on and off planes, trains and automobiles, instead of fumbling with rolling suitcases that typically weigh more than 8 pounds empty. 

I also love that more companies are making duffels with adjustable straps such as this one, as I find that using both handles over one shoulder is far more comfortable for long walks through airports and down city streets, than a single shoulder strap. Somehow this method distributes the weight more evenly for me. Having the option to wear as a backpack is a bonus.

Outdoor Research has done a great thing with the Rangefinder Duffel in terms of making it both weatherproof and attractive looking, as most duffels usually only get one of those two criteria right.

If there was a medium size -- about 22 inches in overall length -- between the small and the large, I think it would be perfect for me. But as it is, the small is too small and the large is too large for my needs, which include using it for domestic and international trips that range in duration from overnighters to more than a week.  

I ask a lot of my gear and this duffel nearly does it all. 

I'm going to try a Fjallraven No. 6 Small next and see how that goes.

Kudos to Backcountry.com for being a great company to work with, both in terms of value (got a great Cyber Monday discount on the bag) and customer service (order shipped promptly with concise confirmation emails; plus, staff was attentive regarding my inquiry about returning the bag).

They told me to wash it with Nikwax Techwash, which I did but that didn't help much. After this, they were nice enough to send me a new jacket under warranty. Great service!

Unfortunately, the second jacket fared the same. After only a few months of casual use, it would wet out at the shoulders completely. In about 10 minutes of moderate rain, my shoulders would be wet beneath the jacket! A year later, the problem has only gotten worse and now the entire jacket wets out quickly.

If you just want a jacket for casual use, get something cheaper like the Marmot Precip that will perform just as well. If you want a real hardshell, spend an extra $100 for something like the Arcteryx Beta LT (which now I own and love). Just don't waste your money on this one.

Also the cinch cord on the waist and hood do a great job of keeping it tight.
I've mainly been using the Foray for splitboarding and storm days in bounds.  I've owned it a little over a year now and have been really stoked on its performance in both rain and snow.  It is so lightweight, and packable which is why I chose it for touring.  I actually just learned yesterday that it packs into the left hand pocket for easy storage in the pack!  Can't believe I went all last winter without knowing this!  Check out the picture.
 In some other reviews people have expressed disappointment with water bleeding through, and I believe that is due to the Gore-Tex membrane.  Over time the fibers don't repel water droplets that well, and they will bleed into the material like one reviewer's photo shows. The water won't actually permeate through the membrane, but it pulls heat off your body through the membrane and feels cold and gives you this unpleasant damp sensation.   I recently learned that to prevent this you need to wash the jacket and then tumble dry on low.  The drying is the critical part here.  Somehow it helps the fibers stand up again and reactivates the DWR.  This is true for all Gore-Tex outerwear!  Read about it here https://www.gore-tex.com/support/care/washing-instructions

I bought the first jacket. I finally got to test it one day on the way to work. From when I got out of my car and got to my desk, I spotted areas wetting out on my left arm. The rain wasn't even what I'd call a downpour, more of a drizzle.

I contacted OR about it, got a new one (just in time for a trip to the Olympic Coast). I was planning to backpack down the coast for 4 days...I had to cut it short by a day. It rained the whole first day...my new jacket wetted out...and got to my baselayer. I was wearing wool so it wasn't all too bad but I was disappointed with this failing gear. By the second night, I was under an emergency blanket while waiting for my baselayers (yes, plural) and jacket to dry out.

Talked to OR again (who are GREAT) and have come to an arrangement. I think OR is great, their design is great. This jacket seems to be an anomaly. Folks swear by their older Forays. But this one was just disappointing. Other reviews say it was a bad batch...but if you look at the dates of these reviews...they spread over a somewhat lengthy time span. Why have they not pulled all the ""bad batches"" yet?

"Outdoor Research","Foray Jacket - Men's","4992964",5,"I've owned this jacket going on five years now. I'm a fisheries biologist, and in that time I've been in warm summer thunderstorms, blizzards, hail, sideways deluges, and strolling through town in a light sprinkle. It's seen regular use in the Cascades and Coastal Ranges of Oregon and California, the both the Eastern and Western Sierra Nevadas, afternoon summer thunderstorms in the Midwest, and in various trips around the country: I rarely go outdoors for extended periods without it in my pack. In my experience, it has worked very well as an outer shell in a layering system (don't expect it to be warm by itself) in the cold and as a easily packable shell for the odd alpine thunderstorm in the summer. It's very breathable (as far as jackets go), incredibly lightweight, the side-zippers offer excellent ventilation, and it has been completely waterproof since I initially purchased it all those years ago. It has kept me as comfortable as I can reasonably expect it to in any situation where I need to wear it. It fits me very well, too, whether or not I am layering up. In my estimation, it has offered excellent performance at a great value. 

Admittedly, I haven't worn many other GoreTex rain jackets to compare it to. Those jackets that I have tried were polyurethane (or other) treated nylon, or equivalent: I could see those being fine for around the town, but they ultimately have a track record of failing with any sustained back country use. Since I've purchased this jacket, I haven't needed to try any others. Other folks I have met, wearing different brands of varying cost, have had jacket-envy.

The side-zippers, pockets and velcro (which I am most surprised by), have held up so far. That being said, the material is starting to fray, particularly the stitching towards the ends of the sleeves; it has picked up some grime and dirt from continued use, which has caused it to start ""wetting out,"" as mentioned in a previous review (it did bead water earlier in it's life, and, as he mentioned, it is still waterproof); and it has probably picked up a particularly fishy odor. None of these are problems that I think a person can reasonably expect to avoid (given how I've used it) with a different jacket.

Once I have to retire this jacket due to failure from regular wear-and-tear, I'll purchase another-- especially at its common sale price of $150.

Edit:

One additional thing worth mentioning that slipped my mind in the initial review is that the jacket does not seem particularly windproof.  Worn by itself on a boat or in heavy winds, wind can cut through pretty easily.

But the knickers are my new favorite summer pant! They’re just the right length to protect my knees from getting…well…nicked, when I don’t want to wear full-length pants in the summer heat. The coverage stays in place when I’m bending my knees too! And they are tapered so they don’t look like clown or pirate pants like some ill-designed capris can. Plus, there’s a soft elastic fabric on the sides of the waist, which makes the efficient optimist in me love how easy it is to drop my drawers (I don’t even bother to undo the hook and unzip them). Also, the off-center hook closure is a bit less cumbersome under a harness than the button and tie closure of the Ferrosi pant. Plus, they’ve kept the zippered pocket in the right place!

For the other comments regarding the pants falling apart: I've probably worn mine climbing, hiking and mountain biking 100 times and they haven't fallen apart yet on me. I will say, the ferrosi material in general has a life cycle where they start to ""pill"" of sorts after the first handful of times wearing them, making them look fuzzy and like they are going to fall apart. Then that fuzziness goes away and they look new again. Not sure why this is, but I've owned probably a dozen different versions of the ferrosi pant and short now and they all seem to do this.

The black is black wool - it has some gray fiber in it, isn't solid black, it does have a sweater texture - and the fleece lining is a very dark greenish color. Might be a little snug in the front on a woman with a larger bust. The 2-way zipper is essential for the length, and the zipper is the right weight for the fabrics, not chunky but very durable. The jacket comes out of the wash smooth and it didn't shrink or wrinkle at the seams at all, and no woolly smells. The only cons are: It's just a little longer than what would look ideal for my height; the wool knit does pill; and I'd rather have hidden zipper pockets than snaps (the snaps look nice, and nothing has ever fallen out of the pockets - but if I want to close a pocket, I want it to be really closed).

"Outdoor Research","HighCamp Gloves - Men's","106971011",5,"There is a lot to love about these gloves. Let's start with the most important - do they keep your hands warm? Yes, and thats coming from a frequent smoker with very poor circulation in his fingers. Temps were fluctuating from the high single digits to upper teens on the mountain with high winds and my hands weren't cold once. I thought surely after a few yard sales, then digging through the snow to retrieve my poles/skis, there would certainly be some numbness in my finger tips. Nope, nothing. My palms were never sweaty even when I started to get winded and my fingers were never cold. Total win.

Waterproofing - As someone that skis probably twice a season, I spend a lot of time on my ass. And, as previously mentioned, retrieving skis/poles from their snowy burials. The Ventia Dry fabric performed brilliantly keeping my hands dry from both internal and external moisture, and the ladder cinch on the wrist coupled with the extra cord at the bottom of the gauntlet ensured I was as happy as could be after rolling four and three quarters in front of the lift as the cute girl from the lodge skied past. 

Other things of note - the liners actually DO work with the touchscreen, which i find to be uncommon with touchscreen-compatible gloves(looking at you, North Face E-Tip). Speaking of the liners, they're a little large to use on their own, but fit perfectly within the larger glove. Might just be my skinny hands.... Is probably just my skinny hands. I'm not sure if it was the curved construction or the softness of the material but my hands felt considerably more dexterous than usual. It may have just been that I had to use them a lot more this time to retrieve skis/poles than in years past, but it definitely kept me happy after considerable wipe outs. 

I should probably also note that chest-deep powder is not a good idea to ski if you only do groomers once or twice a year. Leave the white room to the professionals. 

Finally, I've only used these a couple times now so not sure how they'll hold up season-to-season but I'm just super impressed so far. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-16 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Outdoor Research","Sonic Balaclava","4095731",4,"I own three thin balaclavas, this one, a Mountain Hardwear Power Stretch, and the Smartwool Balaclava. They're usually used for bike commuting in the winter, but they all do double duty on the trail. I bought this one to try and prevent my glasses or goggles from fogging up with every breath. It's hard to tell from the photo, but this balaclava has a mesh screen over the mouth like no-see-um mesh, and the nose hood is open at the bottom. This works great to keep moisture from your breath from coming up between the bottom of the opening and your face (fogging up eyewear), and is the real benefit of this balaclava. This keeps the front from icing up or starting to smell after just a few uses, something that happens with the MH.

This feature also creates a problem; the mesh and nose hood do provide some warmth, but unfortunately not as much as the other two thin balaclava's I own.

The WindStopper/Polartec fabrics work as well as you would expect from other garments you may own. Other than the face area the balaclava is very warm. It would probably be the warmest of the three if my lips and bottom of my nose weren't noticeably colder. While the separate ear fabric doesn't give me bionic hearing, I don't notice any more reduction in hearing than with the other balaclava, which is to say it's fine. As noted by another reviewer, it's plenty stretchy to pull the face opening below your chin, but the nose/mouth mesh make this awkward.

The last flaw with this design might be due to the shape of my face. The mouth mesh makes up the bottom of the nose opening, and pushes against the bottom of my nose in a manner that's uncomfortable. I have to either deal with that, or pull the face covering down so that is rests below the bridge of my nose, which then smooshes my nose and makes it hard to breathe. If you've got a nose on the smaller side, it probably wouldn't be an issue.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2010-11-08 00:00:00","",""

Large was too big in waist, I had to cinch the waist band all the way; i had hiking pants on during the fitting; and the length of the legs was too long, and I was worried about rubbing during hiking. I went with the Medium and still feel they are just a tad small but not a big problem. The real problem is these started to wet out on the first use in the backcountry, and by the second day they were a fail after just 2 hours in the rain. Wet-out was down the entire upper front half of the pant and the lower foot of the pants. The breathability was now compromised, and i started to get nice and moist on the inside of the pant. I also discovered that they are not very durable, as sitting down for one meal I already had a small hole in the seat, lucky my upper shell shielded the hole from rain. The wet out may just be a OR/gore-tex defect/warranty issue, and may not reflect on all of these pants. To have these kind of problems on the first use of these pants is not what I expected. Unfortunately I will have to go to gore-tex or OR for return as I purchased these in winter and have not used them until summer so BC.com will not accept the return. OR makes some great gear but these did meet my expectations. Hope these work better for others. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-08-02 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

"Outdoor Research","Echo Short-Sleeve T-Shirt - Women's","2983962",5,"I purchased this T-shirt for summer hiking and backpacking. I really enjoy lightweight fabrics during summer that breathe well and dry fast.  The Echo T-shirt promised just that.

The fit: 
I am 5'7' and 120 lb, the size I usually wear for outdoor activities is S so naturally I picked the Echo in this size. Once I put it on, I found it semi fitting, the fabric clings a little but it's not skin tight, just like I expected from the manufacturer's description.

Right away I noticed the sleeve's are shorter than what I'm used to. The way they are constructed, they allow for full range of movement without squeezing or pulling my arm. I really enjoy the freedom but my personal preference would be for an extra inch or two of length on the sleeves.

The fabric is thin. It provides good coverage for its weight; however it can show bra marks, especially if you choose lighter color. 

The Performance:
The shirt provides an all day comfort. It does a good job wicking sweat away, and it dries nearly instantly so even on very hot days I did not feel the typical sweaty stickiness building up. 

I was also pleasantly surprised by its odor control properties; it handled a 9 day trip without a significant stink.

I was initially worried that the fabric might be little too thin but even after two years of heavy usage, it holds up with no visible wear marks. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-04-10 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

It has thus far done a great job of keeping the bugs away from me and thus allowing me to keep my sanity.

Pros:
Windproof/waterproof, nice design, gigantic pit/chest zips.
Cons:
Not very comfortable (the inner layer of the jacket seems to grab anything that is not nylon type material, makes it pretty clunky)
I would like it to be a few inches longer as it barely goes over hip bones
Pretty expensive
Zippers are really hard and not very user friendly but I'm sure they'll keep all water at bay.
Pit zips don't have a mesh so forgetting to close them and falling in powder would be a cold disaster

Overall definitely a good purchase for a shell, especially if on sale. Wear a nylon puffy jacket under it and it will slide the way you would expect and not be as uncomfortable.

My favorite feature besides the awesome Gore-Tex water proofing is the venting. Being that this jacket was so killer for resort skiing at Brighton, I was worried about how it would perform in the backcountry. The way the vents on this jacket are arranged makes all the difference. They start underneath your armpit and come up towards your chest.

Engaging the main zipper into the pull tab and box takes some alignment and force (and maybe even some luck?). This does not bode well with my gloves, making it tough to zip up in a jiff, especially when not in the comfort of the indoors.

I  have used this for work on windy days, used it on powder days for snow, and even used it when it rains. This coupled with a down jacket is about all you need to make any day tolerable. The hood even fits over my XL POC Ski helmet. The trick to getting the hood over is to have the jacket unzipped about halfway and then put the hood over, and zip it up the rest of the way. What might be a cool / colder day with no hood instantly feels 20% warmer with the hood up. 

It is mildly annoying to have to adjust the hood for when you aren't wearing a helmet, but that is the sacrifice you make when using a helmet capable hood. 

The arms on the jacket are super long, which is great for someone my size. The sleeves come down to about the middle of my palm. The actual length of the jacket itself is a little short for me, so when I'm riding the lift there is a gap in my pants and my jacket.

 The velcro on the cuffs also needs to be longer in order to cinch the cuffs to your wrists.  They were obviously intended to be worn over your gloves, but I prefer to wear gauntlet gloves over my cuffs.  Oh well, I'll get used to it.

As far as fit goes- well, typically, if I buy in MENS, I get a medium to accommodate my bust. That's what I did here and will say this much- the fit is snug.  This coat is cut on the slim side but will be fine as long as I'm just wearing a slim top underneath.  (as in no sweaters or fleece is going to work, comfortably)  The arm sleeves are lengthy but nothing I can't manage.  Honestly, it's such a beautiful coat.  And WARM...indeed.  It pairs nicely with my tangerine snow pants, too. 
This gal is really thrilled.
Wait until the compliments start pouring in when I wear this and I inform other women, ""Psst!  It's a Men's Jacket!""

Some great features are the headphones port from the chest pocket and the hand pockets are fleece lined.  I hate putting cold hands into cold pockets and these fleece lined pockets are money.

On the other hand, I'm 6', 185lbs. and the medium fits me perfectly. I'm a bit soft in the midsection, so the fill compresses a little when I pack layers beneath it, but there is no pulling of the fabric/stitching. Still, if you plan to layer a lot, or are a between-sizer, the large would still fit slimmer than most medium puffers. I noticed cold spots when I first put it on in 35 degree weather, but I do not notice any now, after regular wearing. I suspect that giving it a good shake upon purchase would help eliminate any threat of cold spots. Also, the gusseting and longer arms help reduce lifting and exposure around belly or wrists. 

All that said, it's an amazing jacket: comfy, warm, more durable than the average pure pertex quantum, light, packable, great attention to detail (love the wrist closures -- hook-and-loop as well as elastic), hand warmer pockets.

I'm about 5'11"" 215lbs, with a larger gut than I would like (mmmmm soda) I bought a large as I do in all outdoor research products. The large fits snug around the mid-section and does seem to have more space than I would like in the armpit and shoulder area, but those could just as easily be attributed to my body opposed to OR's fault. Quality; tough. Mine has seen enough chances to fail that I feel good recommending the quality of it, on top of that, OR has the best guarantee I've encountered. They replace everything!!!

This thing is a workhorse! 
I find the fit to be true if not a tad snug—I’m 5.9, 167 lbs with a 40” chest and have a medium. You might consider ordering a large if you want more layering room.
You can read through the product description to get the tech-specs and whatnot, but the features that really stand out to me are:  
•	Sheds light rain; heavy rain or all day mist will start to seep but, I’ve gotten it pretty wet and the down never clumped—dries fast, overall pretty impressive in this regard.
•	Thoughtfully reinforced high-wear spots, yet this jacket still maintains a light-weight build. 
•	Two-way zippers.
•	Pocket stuff sack (a must for any belay/bivy jkt).
•	The hood is huge, fits a climbing helmet, but also cinches down comfortably.
•	Huge internal pockets (another must for gloves and those times you need to put a hot-water bottle inside your coat).
•	The wire brim in the hood is super thick, and surprisingly effective in keeping warmth in.
•	Outstanding mobility due in part to the slight form-fit.

I have a muscular frame, and am typically a medium but at 5'10"" 175 with broad shoulders, a 41"" chest and a 31"" waist, lots of down jackets fit well in the arms but are too baggy in the waist or too tight in the chest.  I also don't use for climbing, so no need for a higher cut in the front - to me, that just means strange fit and less protection against the cold.  Pulled the trigger on the Diode after much research, and glad I did - fit is awesome from chest down through slim waist.  Super warm jacket so far when wearing out in 20-30 degree weather.

The fit is about the same as the incandescent jacket  and maybe the old Choas jacket, with the roomy body and sleeves.  Very long, actually longer than both those jackets. Keeping the hips warm and easily accommodating a thicker layer underneath.  
This thing is feature packed which I love! huge ""stuff it"" style pockets inside,higher hand pockets, fully adjustable hood and velcro sleeves.  Double seperating zippers are a subtle but key feature for me.  
Admittedly those features made me keep the jacket cause I am very let down in its actual warmth. 
Having owned the Incandescent, Choas, superlayer, and transcendent jackets over the years I was lead to believe this would be in the thicker ""expedition"" style or belay jacket. But its only about as warm as a Transcendent, other mid layer puffys.  
I think OR should throw double the weight of down in this thing to bring it to the level of being used as a stand alone piece or real cold weather jacket.

"Outdoor Research","Whitefish Down Jacket - Men's","4674527",5,"This jacket is great: it has a great athletic/slim fit and also effectively kept me warm and dry this winter. I bought it a few months ahead of winter with the intention of using it in Chicago and eastern Washington beginning in December. It has held up well in both environments. It is comfortable down to around 30 degrees F with just a t-shirt underneath; below that a warm sweater or other long-sleeve is a good plan. I took it out for ~1.5 hours of sledding on a couple occasions when temperatures were about 15 degrees F and wore only a t-shirt and wool sweater underneath and was comfortable and warm the whole time.

"Outdoor Research","Radiant Hybrid Hooded Top - Men's","3937045",5,"This is the closest to perfect I've found in my extensive search for a light fleece with ""tech"" features. I found I reallly liked the coverage options (long sleeves, thumbholes, balaclava hood) on the most recent iteration of the Patagonia R1 but was disappointed by the R1's fabric quality (especially for the insane price) and found it to be either too warm or too cold for my needs. By comparison, the Radiant has pretty much everything I was looking for in a tech fleece.
     I find the fit of the Radiant to be outstanding--""trim"" means relatively fitted for a fit frame, with enough room in the shoulders/chest and a taper so that the  torso/waist isn't baggy. Compared to Patagonia, I really appreciate how Outdoor Research seems to build their products in fit shapes and non-vanity sizes. This helps with both looks and warmth. Although the fit is slim/trim, the length is generous, which addresses a complaint I tend to have with garments that advertise as slim. The hood on this fleece is nice and snug and the offset zipper at the chin is awesome. 
     I love thumbholes but have been dissapointed by several fleeces with sleeve cuffs that are too wide/loose for sealing off the wrists. My R1 cuffs were annoyingly loose after only a few roll ups. The Radiant solves this gripe with sensible use of elastic cuffs. 
     Finally, I like the targeted use of non-grid and grid fleece and the use of a full zip.  I found the full grid fleece of the R1 to be still too warm for active use in temperatures down to the teens (F) but too drafty to provide consistent warmth even when relatively still/sheltered (e.g. in my low 60s house). The non-grid body of the Radiant is quite a bit better about not venting heat when I want to be warm and the full zip allows for ease of layer adjustment or removal; regardless of the relatively high breathability inherent in almost any fleece, I find that I need to actively manage layers if I want to prevent being soaked w/ sweat. Overall, the fleece has so far been the perfect amount of warm for starts and stops during active use in N. Idaho winter temps or for sitting around in a chilly house. I'm sure it'll be great for around camp use during Spring/Fall. 
     Minor Gripes: The zipper pulls are smaller than they should be for winter use and a few more non-tech colors would be nice.

I'll make one last point -- I bought this as a touring shell and it certainly is that.

"Outdoor Research","Realm Jacket - Men's","2111839716",5,"After giving up on hardshells due to lack of breath ability, I think I've found the one for me. The Realm is everything I want from a shell: light, comfortable, breathable, waterproof, and VERSATILE. So far I've only used this during backcountry ski season, but I'm excited to take it to the crag and the trails.

The first thing I noticed about the jacket is how light it is. Even with a wire brim adjustable hood, 2 pockets, and velcro wrist tabs, the jacket weights just 11 ounces... that's light for a jacket with these features and it's one of the reasons why the Realm is so comfortable. 

But the best part of the jacket is the membrane. AscentShell is OR's proprietary version of Polartec Neoshell. What does that mean? It means this thing BREATHES and at a price much lower than other Neoshell jackets.  I've worn this skinning and while I did get a little wet underneath, this jacket handled the perspiration much better than any other hardhsell I've worn.  For reference, I usually skin in just a baselayer top, maybe a light fleece if it's chilly... I'm a very sweaty dude.  What's really impressed me with this jacket is that I'll skin/boot up, whack the jacket on, ski, and by the end of the run I'm dry underneath. I was sweaty as hell when I started, but dry at the bottom.

But all because this is breathable, doesn't mean it won't protect you. I've been out in this when wet snow was falling and no issues at all with wetting out or leaking. I'll definitely be bringing this with me on climbs when I'm thinking it could get nasty out. This guy even packs into it's own interior pocket and has a clip loop.

The feature that I appreciate the most, and this will sound funny, is the wrist closures. Yes, the wrist closures.  Often time jackets have wrists that are too wide, too narrow, awkwardly shaped, with bad velcro, etc. But OR nailed it on this. Half elastic and half velcro means that you don't *need* to redo the wrists every time you take the jacket on/off, but when you do it's super easy and locked down. Cuffs fit well over/under pretty much all gloves I've used, and especially when wearing a large watch such as an Ambit.

Sizing is spot on. Slim enough so it's comfortable and looks good, but definitely enough room to layer. Tucked under a harness, it won't be billowing over the top and make you look like a mutant mushroom.

I haven't been super excited on a piece of gear in a bit, but I really am enthusiastic about this piece and can't wait to see how it does over the long run. No concerns as of yet other than long term durability, but that's the tradeoff that I'm willing to pay for a super light piece of gear.

I encourage you to reach out directly if you have any questions on this or other jackets, such as:
- Can you explain all these membranes to me?
- What jacket is right for me?
- What other lightweight gear do you recommend?

I love the cut and can't wait to put it to use as soon as the spring rain subsides in the Pacific Northwest. It is light and comfy, perfect for running or hiking. I usually wear a medium or 8, but this one fits a little snug. I'll probably stick with the 8, but for a looser fit, don't hesitate to order a size up from your norm.

"Outdoor Research","Expressa Skort - Women's","2346412",4,"This is a super comfortable skort!  The inner short is stretchy and comfortable and the outer skirt flows nicely and has minimal stretch.  There's a zip pocket on the back of the right hip that is plenty big enough for money and credit cards or keys.  I haven't exercised in the skort, but I did wear it outside on some really hot days and it performed beautifully.  

The design is a little odd.  The skirt doesn't have a zipper, so it's one of those that you have to pull over your hips.  There's a stretchy drawstring around the waistband to keep the garment up.  I usually wear a 6 or an 8 in shorts and skirts (5'8"", 150#), so I ordered an 8.  I couldn't get it over my hips and ended up with a 10.  It fits fine, even if I don't tie the drawstring, but it does ride low on my hips.  

Overall, this is a great choice, but you might order a couple of sizes and see which one fits the best - especially if you're curvy!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2012-07-20 00:00:00","",""

I took them to Greece for climbing around ruins, walking around the city, lounging in cafes, and they were perfect. Very functional but also very cute, flirty and stylish (my husband loves them).
