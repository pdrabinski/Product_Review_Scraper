You will be perfect for any weather thrown at you. I am 5'10"" and 165 lbs. and the medium fits perfectly.

"Patagonia","Nano-Air Light Hybrid Insulated Jacket - Men's","2133108",5,"I love my Nano Air hooded jacket but most of the time it is overkill in the warmth department and I end up using it as an insulating outer layer. The Nano Air Light Hybrid is perfect middle ground piece for moving fast with big efforts in the cold or just chilling at work when something more than a t shirt is needed.

 On cold days I am able to use it backcountry skiing over a baselayer layer on the skin up and then pop an insulating jacket or shell over it on the way down. If transitioning fast it insulates well enough to even forego the insulating layer on the way down and just roll with it as the outer layer. When it's sunny and a little warmer I'll skin up in a base layer and add the Nano air light for the down.  I'm always surprised at how wind resistant the chest area is in relation to how well it breathes! That is the magic of multiple materials placed in strategic places. In addition to backcountry skiing I use it nordic skiing on cold days, fat biking (heaven forbid),  cold bike commutes as an mid or outerlayer, etc etc...
 I love the contoured fit and at 5'9' 150 lbs feel the size small was tailor made for me. I often wear it at work in the clinic on cold mornings and never end up taking it off because it regulates temperature  so well. 
This is one piece that I need in multiple different colors so everyone doesent  realize that I'm actually wearing the same piece everyday for about every type of activity...","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-19 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Patagonia","Nano-Air Light Hybrid Insulated Jacket - Men's","1230244",5,"I typically run hot when active and cold when stopped. The original nano air was too warm for me while active. I have also owned a 40 gram primaloft gold jacket with fleece side panels (ala Atom LT) and found it didn't breath well enough on the back panel when active.

The nano air light is a great piece for me in that it's a medium boost of insulation when worn over other layers, or much warmer under a wind breaker. Since I typically am wearing a pack less insulation on the back is appreciated. I consider it to be a much more versatile fleece (can't get much out of a fleece over a windshirt). 

Some examples of use:
*Ice climbing WI4-5 pitches with a thin t shirt and grid fleece around -10 to -5F. Used a thin windshirt over the top during windy approach and on easier approach pitches.

*Ski touring with no base layer at 27-30 degrees. Just to test breathability. Would sweat a bit in the front with zip down. Threw a hard shell over the top only and the whole jacket was dry and warm to the skin by the base of the run.

*Ski touring insulator for the ride down. I'll typically tour up in a very thin synthetic t or long sleeve and need more for the ski down. The nano is the perfect touch of warmth. Easier to slide on fast than any of my fleece mid layers. Dries out the base layer very fast when I do sweat on the up, especially in the back.

*Hiking and cragging in 40-50 degrees. It offers a boost of warmth on the flatter portions of approaches, if it's a steep uphill I would still strip down to a t-shirt. While cragging moderate rock with temps around 40 and some light wind I left the  nano on, did not overheat climbing and was just comfy while belaying. 

I see myself bringing this along for alpine climbing in the summer. On the descent of routes I think it will be a perfect boost of warmth over a windshirt. Since I can pull it on and off quickly it's much more versatile than taking a windshirt on/off to get a fleece underneath. 

My only gripe about the piece may be specific to my build, but it's shared with a lot of climbers. I have relatively low body fat and ""popeye"" forearms, lots of veins close to the skin. My elbows and underarms have been cold when I wear just the nano light or have it over a windshirt. I wish they would have the waffle fabric cover the back, sides, and armpits only. I could use a little bit more warmth under the forearms. Minor gripe.

Fit wise, I""m 5'8"" and 155lbs, most of the weight in the thunder thigh quads.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-03 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

I've been wearing mine a ton backcountry skiing on colder days, mountain biking, and as an around town piece.  I find myself wearing it even more than a regular Nano Air since it's lighter and more versatile.  The back stretch panel is from a Fall trail running piece and is super comfortable with what seems like just the right amount of stretch.  The thumb loops and stretch material that make up the cuff are the icing on the cake - it's not often guys get thumb loops on a jacket like this.

"Patagonia","Nano Puff Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","109542096",5,"For three years, this was my absolute go to piece, then I got the Patagonia Nano Air hoody and this Nano Puff has fallen to my second most reached for layer. 

While the Nano Air breathes quite well for a midlayer, this Nano Puff does not, which is sometimes a very good thing. I run hot, and if hiking or climbing in cold temps, I can work up a sweat wearing very little all the way down past freezing. So if on a climb, the Nano Air would be a much better choice for me at a belay station, where I'm subject to get chilly from the wind while I sit for maybe an hour. Similarly, while hiking, I may be in a tshirt or thin baselayer while moving, but when we stop to eat or regroup I want to trap all that heat I've worked for, and not let the wind steal it all. I still bring the Nano Puff for both of these situations.

The Nano Puff packs down incredibly small for a windproof, synthetic piece. That makes it a prime contender on summer backpacking trips to the alpine, where we know we may see freezing temps overnight or cold and windy storms during the days. While being coated with DWR, and windproof, this isn't a rain shell and will need to be layered properly in a downpour lest it wet out. Luckily, being synthetic, it'll still keep you warm when wet, but it definitely won't be comfortable and you'll have to wear it dry in your tent for hours.  This quality makes it an awesome emergency piece, a just in case safety net that weighs 3/4 of a pound but will cut wind or cold in any scenario. 

Mine has been incredibly durable, 5 years in now, with only a few small patches from wear and abuse. I take good care of it, but I don't baby it like I am known to do with some down jackets.

The fit on mine, again a model from many seasons back, is smaller than my Nano Air from 2015. The cut is a bit short, and the arms are too, but I still like the look more than sizing up and swimming in the chest. I'm unsure if Patagonia has changed the cut since, so can't speak to the newer versions. 

This is a great, practical midlayer that fills many holes in the wardrobe. It is not a breathable midlayer, if you keep that in mind, you will not be disappointed, as it will keep you warm and the wind at bay.

I'm in the PNW so winds and rain are pretty common, and winter temps are fairly moderate unless you're in the mountains.

In my opinion this is a great 3 season piece. I take good care of my things but have definitely crammed it in a lot of packs and snagged it on rocks and it's held up well, and despite lots of compression I haven't noticed much decrease in warmth over the years.

It holds up well in the rain, both in water resistance and in loft and blocks wind fairly well, while still being pretty breathable. I hike fairly hot so will still get swampy in this unless it's say, summit day at Mt. Baker and it's cold and windy AF. 

It fits well though I could use a bit more length and/or a two way zipper for some extra length. I'm just over 6 ft and hover around 190-200 lbs and the M fits me well. Can't layer too much underneath but works as a great midlayer with a soft or hardshell too.

This thing is absurdly breathable, which means it's great for some things and bad for  others.

But for wearing while hiking, skiing, running, etc. in cold weather where you need some warmth, but would rapidly over heat in a traditional insulated jacket... it is incredible. 

To be clear, I still use this as my go-to around town jacket for fall and spring, but mid-winter you need to either add a shell over it or grab a normal puffy. 

The primary reason I bought this though, and the purpose it serves that makes it worth every penny to me, is for ski touring in the winter. Every other insulated jacket I ever owned I had to remove and put in my back at some point on my ski tour because even on the coldest days they would make me sweat. This jacket breathes so well that I can keep it on and fully zipped on most tours without getting excessively sweaty. Not only does that mean less over-heating on the hike, but I stay dry so I don't get as cold at the top of the hike either. Then I throw my shell on for the ski down, and with a shell over it this jacket is plenty warm. 

If you are just looking for a more casual jacket to wear around all winter, Patagonia has better offerings like the hi-loft down hoody (which is what I grab when it gets too cold for the nano-air). ","EMPLOYEE","2017-11-22 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

It seems like this jacket is on sale all the time. I don't think it is worth the full price, and if I were paying full price for a synthetic mid layer, I would probably go with the Atom LT. That being said, when you can get it for under $150, it's a great jacket. I find that it's comfortable in a fairly wide temperature range, and I don't have to take it off immediately when I start moving. The breathability is good, but be aware that this means your phone will get soaked in your chest pocket (at least in my experience). This jacket has a regular fit, so it's not super slimming, and doesn't fit very well under athletic cut shells (which can be annoying when trying to climb with this layer), but excels as a mid layer under other regular cut shells. I will use this jacket as an outer layer when it's not too cold, but agree that it doesn't block wind very well, and definitely doesn't block rain. I'm not super impressed with the durability, as I have noticed some pilling around the neck and lower back. Also, the hooded version has two chest pockets, while the non-hooded only has one. Not sure what the reasoning was behind that, but I find myself reaching for the hooded version more often. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-06-08 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

First of all, the jacket new looks relatively used out of the bag. The material just looks dingy/wrinkly when compared to the nano puff or other branded mid-layers/soft shells. It's also anything but resistant to staining, so be careful. Secondly, the zippers are robust enough, but the cloth gets caught up in the them way too easily, especially the pockets. One has to be very deliberate to get them opened or closed with one pull. Annoying! Underneath another layer it provides good insulation for the weight, but by itself it's totally permeable to the elements. That said, nestled in between a Cap 4 base and a GT Pro shell, I stayed relatively warm on a butt cold summit day to the top of Aconcagua, so mission accomplished. Of course, after three weeks of use and two washes, it's still stained and looks dingier than when it was new.  Therefore, it's now relegated to my technical clothing box as I will only use it from now on as a non-visible mid-layer.

I have both jackets in size L, but they don't fit that similarly.
 The Nano Puff has a nice 'boxy' fit that I've heard a lot of complaints about, but I think it is actually pretty rad. I like the loose fit because I think the jacket moves better and feels more mobile than it might if it were cut to fit more snuggly. 
The Nano Air is cut to fit more snuggly, and while that necessarily a bad thing, it is mostly cut to fit closely through the shoulders and chest - it is kind of shaped like a bell or a pear.
The Nano Air's face fabric is kind of soft and I think that it is a bit warmer than the Nano puff. That said, they are pretty comparable jackets. 
If you are looking into both and hoping to differentiate, I think it is probably worth going for whichever best suits your needs. I've heard that the nano air layers really well under waders for fishing or under a bib while skiing, but I think the Nano puff is better suited to climbing and the alpine.

"Patagonia","Nano-Air Insulated Hooded Jacket - Men's","109542096",5,"I'm entering my third winter with my Patagonia Nano Air Hoody and can honestly say this is a five star piece. It kinda makes me regret giving 5 stars to other pieces, because it may be the most loved piece in my kit. 

My Nano Air fills the need on so many days, it's unbelievable. I use it as jacket outerwear on days from 30-55 degrees, or even colder days when I'm just running to the store or to work. I layer a base underneath it for snow shoveling in almost any condition, as I know I'll work up a sweat in anything that doesn't breathe as well. I've worn it under a shell at the ski resort, or over a tshirt while skinning up on a tour. I've slept with it under my 35 degree bag on nights when the temp falls below freezing and this is the warmest layer in my pack. This piece has been to the top of over 20 mountains. It has also been to the beaches of California to warm me after swimming or surfing all day. 

It is incredibly cozy, sometimes I get home and just don't take it off. The face fabric feels more durable than a standard down puffy, or even the Nano Puff, but a nasty day of bushwhacking without a shell may push it to it's limit. That said, when hiking around off-trail, I'm not near as conscientious as I am with a down puffy. 

I have put at least 300 days in by now with my Nano Air, and would replace it IMMEDIATELY if it were ever lost, stolen, or somehow destroyed. It is so versatile it will usually end up in the bag because it does so many things as well as competitors, and a certain few (looks, breathability, comfort) significantly better.

If you're looking to buy a midlayer that is more than just a layering piece, look no further. Just know what this isn't, it isn't a standalone jacket for 20 degree days, and it isn't waterproof. My advice is to get a color you love, cause you'll be wearing it a LOT.

I am 6 feet, 160 ish with longer arms than I am tall, and I purchased a small. It's been perfect, as I never intended for this to fit over anything other than tshirts or merino/capilene baselayers. This is a midlayer that looks like a well cut jacket if layered over light clothing.

I work as a field biologist in arctic Alaska, studying cliff-nesting falcons. This often requires rappelling in to  their nest sites on extremely sharp, loose rock. We usually use rope protectors, but sometimes forget them and use one of our extra layers to protect the rope from the rock instead. This particular day, the only extra layer I had on hand was my Nano Air. I grudgingly placed it on the jagged lip of rock and ran the rope over it, and we went about our business. As we were finishing and pulling the rope, we were hit by a sudden frigid downpour and quickly gathered our materials and got out of there. A  3-mile slog later, soaked and freezing and exhausted, I realized with dismay that my prize possession, my Patagonia Nano Air was nowhere to be found. I whipped out the binoculars and there it was, shining lime green through the mist, stranded on the cliff face. Due to the nature of our biology project, we were unable to return to the site for 3 weeks. And there it stayed, exposed to the extreme elements of arctic Alaska, whipped by wind and pummeled by rain against the knife-edged rocks. I had written off all hope of retrieving this jacket, but lo and behold the three weeks went by and we found ourselves again at the cliff. Right where I left it, I picked it up and was amazed to find not a scratch on it. Once through the washer, and it was good as new, and I wear it to this day.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-08-27 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

This jacket seems to run a bit large for its size, both in sleeve length and in the body.  It is rather baggy on me despite the nano puff fitting perfectly.  As this is a mid layer or outer layer I can understand that it leaves a little room for layers underneath, but this jacket leaves a little too much room.  I wish I could try on a medium, but I've already worn this on multiple climbing trips and it wouldn't be right to trade it in now.  It does an excellent job keeping me warm when I'm not moving while at the same time it dumps excess heat when I'm actually climbing.  This is key as I don't have to adjust layers constantly.  I also like the mechanical stretch which gives me better range of motion when reaching or contorting my body into weird positions.  I also really like the double chest pockets.

The cuffs are shaped awkwardly in that they don't taper like the comparable options from other brands, so you end up with too long of sleeves that bunch up into big puffy masses around your wrists.

UPDATE: So I took a chance and ordered a size small... it went back to Patagonia the next day. Almost perfect but chest/shoulders was a little tight and that didn't work for me. It's a shame, because I really wanted to like this jacket - it looks fantastic. In the end, though, I didn't feel the love, and at that price, I just couldn't motivate sticking with it.

Pros: 
- Its seriously small when its packed up - it packs into its own pocket. Its barely bigger than the size of an avocado. Its easy to pack into itself, but has room that makes me think it could be even smaller if need be.
- The hood is great and can fit up and over a beanie no problem.
-  Like Kyle mentions below, it does fit in a fanny pack for mountain biking just fine.

Warmth: The lining on the inside makes a big difference. They're not insulated but very warm for a shell and because of that lining you can wear them comfortably without a base layer in the spring. 

Breathability: They are warm. And goretex is not air permeable so I got too warm in them skiing bumps. But there are big side vents for dumping heat which I used a lot. I was also skiing in spring like conditions so that may also be why they felt so warm.

"Patagonia","Performance Better Sweater Fleece Jacket - Women's","656650674",5,"I'm a sucker for jackets. Patagonia is one of my all time favorite makers-of-jackets, and I have spent a lot of hours in my Houdini this summer and the R2 has always been a cooler weather favorite. With temperatures in Utah finally dropping, this fleece has quickly made it to a top choice in my jacket rotation. 

The first thing I noticed is that when I slip it on it fells like a warm fuzzy hug. The inside is super cozy fleece that feels AWESOME--it's honestly the jacket I reach for every morning when I go out back to grab eggs (and the pockets are nice and big!)  I'm pretty slim, and most Patagonia jackets tend to fit a bit more on the boxy side--not this one. It's slim fit, and the stretch panels on the side not only allow for movement when hiking or climbing, but give it a flattering silhouette also (I like the fit so much more than the R2 fleece from a couple years ago).
It's thick enough that it really keeps the chill off when I'm up in the cool mountain air, but not so thick that it limits physical activity or range of motion. I think this is going to be a new favorite for winter running, a great mid-layer when it really gets cold, and I think it will be perfect for winter climbing trips in the desert. 

One last thing I want to talk about that is never mentioned enough, it the no-stink-factor with so many of Patagonia's layers. I've worn this up a few peaks in the last month, and then throw it on to run errands around town, because it still smells great :)

"Patagonia","Bivy Hooded Down Vest - Women's","5301222",5,"This is one of the few 5 star items hanging in my closet. I'm a beast when it comes to reviewing jackets (my closet is full of an embarrassing amount) and I have few 5 star coats in my arsenal.  Here is why this one takes the cake. 

1. Recycled Down: WHAT? Yes. Patagonia responsibly sources their down from products like comforters, old jackets, or pillows and gives it a new life rather than sacrificing new birds to keep us warm. I think that is pretty darn neat, and I feel a little bit better about sporting down, knowing this fact. 

2. Fit is Perfect: I don't know what those wizards are doing over at Patagonia but their woman's fit is one word: DIALED. I am 5'3"" and 120lbs and the size small is perfectly tailored in every way. 

3. Details, Details, Details: I loved the silky taffetta lining inside the vest. It's a lovely floral pattern. I think it beautifully contrasts with the more masculine and utilitarian feel of the tough/thick DWR outer fabric. This appeals to my inner girly-girl, who I try to keep hidden. The pockets are lined with a nice, cozy fabric that's ideal for chilly hands. 

4. Durability: Besides being water resistant this fabric is really abrasion resistant too. It's thick and ready to rumble. I honestly do not mind paying a little extra for a Patagonia product, because I have perfect confidence it will spend the next 10 years in my closet. 100% worth it 100% of the time, every time. 

5. Classic: I may not be much of a fashionista, but the clean lines on this vest won't go out of style anytime soon. It's cozy, cute, and fetching. Did I also mention it's warm? I tend to run hot, so adding an extra layer to my core is the perfect way to bundle up on chilly mornings or campfire nights. With the down feathers, this one is warmer than most; it's QUITE thick! But not so thick as to transport you into Michelin Man territory.

I'd been lusting after this vest for 18 months. I can't say I'm surprised but it's my most commonly used piece of fall attire. Can't wait to apres all over the canyons in this thing for winter!

The Tropic Comfort is Patagonia's 'minimalist' option, and I appreciate that it isn't covered in unnecessary pockets or zippers. The thumb holes at the cuff keep the sleeves down over the backs of my hands, and the button on the collar helps me adjust the height of the neck easily.
Aside from those two features, there isn't a lot to Tropic Comfort. Patagonia's UPF fabric breathes well, is reasonably abrasion resistant, and the colors options are nice!
I think that the Tropic Comfort runs pretty true to size. Mine is a bit baggy, but I think that it is more comfortable to move in that way, and don't think a close fit will prove nearly as breathable as a more relaxed option.

The recycled polyester is blended really well and isn't super dense, so it doesn't make the fit of the overall sweater stiff and it feels good against my skin -- not scratchy.
It's also way warmer than I anticipated it to be as well. Not super wind resistant, but I wouldn't wear this as an outer layer anyways. It's great as a fall midlayer or lounging around the apartment in fuzzy socks and leggings on a chilly night! 
The only thing that docked a star for me was the sizing -- I usually wear an XS in most garments  but the sleeves and hem of the sweater are a little shorter than I would expect (and I'm a fairly short person). The collar is a little  tall too -- not tall enough to be annoying but if I were to button it up all the way It would be kind of tight under my chin.

Despite my emotional connection to my old vest the nano puff version is better in my opinion. Namely, it has a trimmer fit and overall lower profile. Anecdotally, it has a bit less insulation than my old vest which makes it even more versatile as a mid layer for those warmer winter days when my Arc Teryx Atom LT is too much and it makes it more practical for fly fishing on summer mornings that end up heating way and result in the vest being stashed in a pack at 11AM.

The previous R-line had a unique fleece fiber that I haven't encountered in any other brand or line. Unfortunately, Patagonia chose to update their R-line so that it mirrored less competitive rival brands and their materials. 
I sent my R2 jacket in to be repaired and wrote specific notes about how I would pay for any repairs that they could not fix for free. I expected the detailed notes to be an obvious sign that I would like to keep my jacket. However, I had inadvertently neglected a box that noted if they could throw my item out after they had determined if it could be repaired or not. This was particularly upsetting because they DO NOT MAKE THIS JACKET anymore and it had strong sentimental value! When I sent my pack to REI recently, they called to let me know they received it and emailed pictures of the damaged areas to make sure they knew what I intended to be repaired.

Fit: 

-I'm hit and miss with Patagonia clothing.  I typically require a large due to my broad shoulders, no matter the cut. Some Patagonia apparel that are ""regular fit"" (Nano Air, flannel) are too baggy around my belly. The R1 is a slim fit and fits me perfectly in a large. Slim but not too snug. I can easily wear a baselayer underneath and a shell/insulation layer over. *If you are a taller, slimmer guy, this will fit well.* I'm so impressed with how comfortable this jacket is.

True to its name, it can carry as much as you could conceivably bring on any length trip (up to multi-week / month w/ limited washing). You know when you find something that just works well? This is it for suitcases/duffels, no need to shop around further.

I've used the duffel for a two week trip around New Zealand's South Island as my primary bag and on other, shorter trips where I needed the extra room. In NZ, it was large enough for two weeks clothes etc. + ski gear, but still had backpack straps to make the trips to and from the car / through airports relatively easy. You just use a day pack to carry what you need for any given time period and treat this bag like a walk-in closet. The backpack capability beats the hell out of wheels in any condition except perfectly paved concrete (try finding that at small winter airport or town!). I haven't needed the waterproofing to any extent, but the peace of mind is nice and the material seem like they would wear well in wetter conditions. The single inner zip pocket is really helpful too--great dirty clothes hamper.

Since buying the bag in June, I've seen it and its smaller brethren numerous times in airports and shops, and most recently grabbed the wrong bag (same color/size, Forge Grey) off the baggage claim line. As of writing, it's on sale--easy decision for those on the fence. Get it!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-19 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

On my last hut trip, I was informed that the 1989 expedition weight capilene base layer I had been wearing since my first trip to Alaska was becoming a little too close to transparent.

So to start the ski season off right, I caved and treated myself to an adult onesie.

Fit wise, just like most of Patagonia's clothing, the specs were spot on and the sizing ran true.

I wore it the first night around the house with a huge smile on my face.

This morning I wore it ski touring and it was all I had hoped it would be.

Gaps or seams that leave exposure to cold blasts were non-exisitant. The one piece design prevented riding up or riding down. The built in hood was perfect for the first 10 minutes of uphill travel before my body warmed up (it was before sunrise and 13Â° when we started moving), rolled it down as I got warm. Then when I came to a stop, it was right there to be popped back on under the helmet as we ripped skins and pointed them back down to the base and on to work.

It was out of stock everywhere and in between seasons, so I was told I'd be waiting 12 months. I even checked the strangely stocked Patagonia outlet store in that country, just in case. A week or two later, Backcountry happened to have one single pair in my size and I nabbed it.

One time this past winter, I headed out for a day of touring and forgot to pack my ski pants while wearing these at home. I decided to just go for it.

If I want a warm layer, I'll just go with my down sweater, if I want a lighter piece I'll go with something breathable like the Nano Air hybrid.

That being said, I have been reaching for this one as my camping layer this summer, and as far as an every day jacket goes, here's why this pullover is great: 
THE POUCH: Honestly, all jackets should have a pouch like this one. I can run into stores without a purse, and put my phone, keys, and wallet in the magical  pouch--it's holds SO much--plus there are still pockets for my hands. I also have an irrational fear of being somewhere without a snack--I can stash all kinds of goodies in this pouch!
COMFORT: Super soft, super comfortable.

(You know this has happened). This actually just pulls right off you head--no flashing your friends, no asking for help.
It's not baggy, it's not fitted, it's just right. 

The hood doesn't do much for me--it's tiny, but I'll for sure take this into some chilly canyons in the fall-I know it will fit great under a helmet.

As a technical layer, I find the cut to be a downside. It's great to layer beneath and wear as an outermost layer in town, but I find that looseness in the hip, particularly,  makes it bunch oddly underneath a shell for other uses. It does best, in my opinion, as an outer-most layer.

The fit is great for me, allowing room for a hoodie underneath,  while maintaining comfort. I also appreciate the length: just about butt-length on my 5'6"" frame.

I'm 99% of the time a medium in Patagonia, and the same holds true for the Bivy. Even with my larger bust, sometimes a fit issue, it fits supremely well in a medium","EMPLOYEE","2017-03-31 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer","true"
"Patagonia","Nano Puff Bivy Insulated Pullover - Women's","106312630",5,"I'm a big fan of the Nano Puff series, it was no surprise that I totally fell in love the Nano Puff Bivy Pullover. It effortlessly waffles between a true technical piece and a lifestyle jacket. I'm able to wear this pullover while skiing or hiking, though I do foresee myself wearing it while climbing come warmer months.  And (best of all), I can wear it to work without having to think twice about whether or not it looks out of place. The under-the-helmet hood is awesome not to mention, actually fits under the helmet, which not-so-subtly hints at the versatile design of Patagonia's products. 

Meanwhile, the coolest part about this pullover is the fact that it touts a largely recycled construction. The exterior material is entirely recycled, which is awesome if you're an eco-conscious shopper, and the Primaloft Gold Eco insulation touts a 55% post-consumer recycled content—so I'm able to feel good about wearing this piece. 

The pockets are stellar: the kangaroo pocket provides quick and easy respite for cold digits—an ideal detail that has come in handy for me when I walk the dogs. The zippered pocket keeps necessities (e.g. snacks!) close at hand and secure without getting in the way of my arms. The center front zipper allows me to dump excess body heat quickly without forcing me to remove the jacket in its entirety.

As for the fit: I long struggled with the cut and design of the Nano Puff pullovers - I really liked the idea of them, but could never get the right fit. In the past, they were either too tight in the shoulders or too short in the torso which made reaching for holds while climbing not only difficult, but kind of unpleasant thanks to the hem lift and the restrictive shoulders. 

Thankfully, the 2017 rendition seems to have absolved this issue just about entirely. In comparison to years' prior, the Nano Puff Pullover is more ""true to size"" than it does run large. I typically can wear an XS or Small in Patagonia items, with XS being a more ""true to fit"" and a Small being more relaxed. I own a Small and the fit is definitely relaxed, thus being true to size. That being said, this is intended to be a proper midlayer, so how you prefer your midlayers to fit (be it snug or slightly relaxed) is entirely up to you. I prefer to have the option to layer underneath the jacket should the conditions call for it, hence why I chose the Small rather than the XS.

Bottom Line: This piece provides me with the dependable and versatile performance I've come to love and know from the Nano Puff series, but now features a better fit design than years' prior.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-07 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Patagonia","Nano Puff Bivy Insulated Pullover - Women's","2873523",5,"Overall, 5 stars because this jacket is sweet looking (that's all that really matters). 

STYLE:
This is a really unique look compared to what we have available to us - the kangaroo pouch is coming back in style! The contrasted colored zippers makes the jacket pop a little more and the colors are clutch, true to form for Patagonia.

FUNCTIONALITY:
Let's be real folks - this jacket couldn't get more functional. Well, maybe if we added sleeve pockets and a chest zipper, but it isn't needed here. Your marsupium (derived from the Latin word ""marsuppium,"" which means a purse or a pouch.) will hold anything you need for the day. I took a trip to Lowe's with my wallet, phone, keys, portable battery charger and 2 doorknobs in there. I looked a little puffier, but I wouldn't normally carry doorknobs. I hate purses and this thing makes it possible to ditch the bag. I also don't have to worry about things falling out of my pocket. I don't recommend actually putting a child in there - I tried and he almost fit (10 lb baby, in case you wondered).  The kangaroo pouch is SEPARATE from side hand entry pocket - so it's almost like you have two pockets, but they occupy the same belly space. I find it easier to put my phone in side entry pocket and everything else in the pouch so I don't have to dig for my phone. 

WARMTH:
If I could rate this separately, I would. I'd probably give it a 4 star. That said, we all know Primaloft just doesn't compare to real down, but it's a lot easier to take care of. It's all about preference. I tested my nano puff out in below freezing temps as my main jacket source. I was not as toasty as I am in my Ghost Whisperer:  http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-ghost-whisperer-hooded-down-jacket-womens?skid=MHW00AY-BK-XS&ti=U2VhcmNoIFJlc3VsdHM6Z2hvc3Qgd2hpc3BlcmVyOjE6NjpnaG9zdCB3aGlzcGVyZXI=

I wear the GW every day as my main - but the nano puff just wasn't made for those temps on it's own. If it's a chilly day in the office, treat it like a hoody and it's perfect, and you might actually get too warm. Throw on a shell or another jacket over the nano puff and you will be golden - it insulates as it's supposed to. I was perfectly warm with another jacket over top and just kept the nano puff on as a hoody.

My only other complaint is that after about 2 wears, I started to notice the primaloft fuzz coming out of the seams a bit. This is minor, but I don't want to lose all the insulation over time! It's not noticeable unless you pay super close attention. 

THE HOOD (yes this gets its own section):
Without a scarf, my neck would have froze. Some jackets have a puffy enough hood to kind of keep the wind out when the hood is down. This hood is DESIGNED for a helmet, so it's super small laying on your back - but once you pull it up, that thing will keep ALL air out. And you will look like you are getting ready to go up in space.  If you need that kind of security in your life, this hood is the bomb diggity. I don't really and only pull it up to get a few laughs. It will surely matte your hair down and leave an elastic marking on your forehead, but if you have a helmet on, that thing isn't going anywhere. 

THE FIT:
Runs a bit small. I am a Medium in Patagonia through and through and sometimes find their stuff to run a little big. Because of the material of this jacket - it doesn't have any give or stretch, so getting it on over my shoulders and situated makes me not want to take it off a million times, but once it's on, it fits perfectly. The only part that is a bit snug is around my hips, but I have bigger hips. I am 5'2"" and a size 6 or 8  in pants, but because I am shorter, it probably hits me lower that it will if you are taller and the hip thing might not even be an issue. I have a medium in this, I typically wear small or medium in Women's clothing. I feel like a large would be too big on me in the shoulders and look silly, and a small would be too tight around my hips.

Overall, I say GET THIS JACKET!! :) ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-04 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Patagonia","Capilene Lightweight Crew Long-Sleeve Shirt - Men's","107901349",5,"I have been focusing on my base layers this year with aspirations of controlling how sweaty I get. I sweat, I do not perspire! Therefore, I needed good first layers to move moisture away from my body both when I am hiking and when I am running. I purchased two short-sleeved lightweight and two long-sleeved shirts, one light weight and one midweight. I have been mostly running but I have gotten out a couple times snowshoeing with these.

For all activities that I have used them for they have been excellent. They do soak up sweat but they also get rid of it very quickly, even with additional layers over top. As the only layer when I am running they are saturated in some places but much less so than other shirts I typically run in (I live in the PNW and it is still very humit as of writing this review). In fact, they are so good that I have been running in the capilene shirts almost exclusively since I purchased them (about 5-6 weeks)

The first thing you'll notice is that this shirt, even the midweight, is extremely thin. Typically I only wear a shirt or shorts once and then wash it. However, after a couple of washings of these shirts, I noticed that they had signs of wear. There were little snags and distortions in the fabric. I began to worry that these would not last long enough to make them worth the cost. I thought about buying several more to lighten the burden but then decided to do a little testing first. Since these shirts are treated with polygene they should not stink as much as a typical polyester. So I wore one shirt for two weeks running 4 times per week and hang drying it after rather than washing. I ran once in a standard poly shirt and let it hang dry for the two weeks as a control. The standard poly, as you can imagine, stunk after a couple of days. The capilene got a little funky but not unbearable. Even better, when I start to sweat in a standard poly that already has the funk, it stinks even worse when it gets wet; not the polygene capilene. Though they were a little funky, they never got worse even resoaked in my sweat the following day. I then decided that I would repeat the test but rinse the shirts after each run in my post-run shower. This time there was a slight funk but barely noticeable (and no complaints from the wife which is the real test).

In the end, I decided not to purchase any more shirts but instead wash the shirts much less than my typical running stuff. Because the shirts are so thin, I rinse them in my post-run shower and they are dry and ready by morning for the next run. This cuts down on the number of washes and will, in theory, increase the longevity of the shirts.

Amazing shirt and, in a way, cuts down on washing and waste as a result. When I need another one I will be purchasing another one of these shirts without thinking twice.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-27 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

The medium has been great for a toiletry bag--sunscreen, deodorant, hairbrush, toothpaste, facewash--I can put everything I need for a few weeks in here. I love that there are two zip pockets--I can put some necklaces/bracelets/watches in and not worry about them falling out. 

The small has been a great little bag to put some basic first aid supplies in. I keep it loaded and throw it in the car or the climbing bag. 

They are also the perfect size for loading up with snacks and putting in a backpack or dry bag so your trail mix and granola bars don't end up scattered and lost inside your pack.

 The picture for the large doesnt do it justice. I was able to fit 12 quick draws, and PAS under one mesh side. Harness and chalk bag in the other mesh side, then close it up with my shoes inside. It easily lashes to the outside of my rope bag making storing and travelling with my climbing gear incredibly easy. 

My favorite part about having separate sturdy bags like this is you can keep them packed, then just grab and go. The nylon is durable and can repel some light snow or moisture.

Backcounty was very helpful in making sure I received it in time. I have always had a great experience with their customer service.
 
Now for the review! I was watching Red Beard's video on the AT and he highly recommended this piece so I bought in and I was not disappointed. I did not want to take it off. It worked well through a range of temperatures  40-60's. Great around camp and on the trail. Even when It was warmer the ¼ zip allowed some ventilation and the quick drying material wicked away the moisture. The hood was awesome.  I was constantly putting my hood off and on while hiking over the balds in and out of the shade. Instant warmth and protection quickly. The piece worked very well under my down hooded jacket. Double hoods in the cold for the win! I bought the black version which did not show dirt but in the intense sun warmed up quickly but not too much. I will be buying a second one in a different color because it is such a versatile piece.
 
Sizing. It is designed to be a tight fit. I am 5'10"" 170lbs and typically am between a medium and large. I ordered the medium and it fit perfect. I wore a close fitting undershirt and it was a perfect combo. The hood design has a high collar and can be worn without the hood up. When up it cradled my face well and left my mouth area open.  
 
This would be a great piece for skiing and many other outdoor adventures. The waffle like weave worked well for wicking and comfort. The fabric felt nice and it showed no wear for the 5 days of rugged use. I hope this review is useful to for my fellow adventures.

It's that time of year when a solid base layer is essential for active outdoor play. For me, whether it's getting some lift serviced laps on the local hill, early morning runs on the trail, or hiking on the frigid coast of Lake Superior as the sun sets, this base layer has become invaluable to me over the last few months. The fit hugs your body which is perfect and how a layer like this should fit. I really like the cut, gusseted underarms and build. Solid work by Patagonia once again. The small details like the thumb loops and the high collar are huge bonuses. I like that with the hood on and fully zipped, the collar acts as a built in neck gator - great for when the temps are low and the wind is blowing.

The big thing for me is the Polar-tech Power Grid fleece fabric that Patagonia has used. It is super comfortable and keeps me warm in temps down to the single digits. Running is always the big test for me when it comes to testing the breathability of a fabric and this top performs beautifully. Even when I use my windshell (Patagonia Houdini) on my run, I don't find myself sweating through - something I've experienced before with other insulated tops. 

I really feel like this is the perfect cold-weather layer when temps are below 25. Whether it's chillin at camp during a winter outing in the backcountry, hitting the slopes at the local hill, or high-intensity activities like running or biking, it does it's job beautifully.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-01-08 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

Hats are one of those things that seem like someone shouldn't be picky about, but I totally am. Its got to have the right brim, the right colors, and the right fit. This nails it out of the park. 

I typically prefer a trucker style mesh on the back, but don't mind the cotton canvas all the way around. It fits somewhat deep on the head, but in a good way - some fit deep and make my ears look weird, this doesn't do that.

"Patagonia","Synch Fleece Poncho - Women's","106312630",5,"Bottom Line: This is a car camping, lounge-around-the-house, run-your-errands staple. 

The material is the same fleece-y goodness as the Snap-T pullover, so know that it's hella cozy, durable, and warm. The collar enhances your defense against cool evening air, while the hood ensures that you're really able to snuggy-down-in-there. I kind of felt like a fleece-wrapped turtle in it, in the best of ways of course. 

I love the zippered pockets and the fact that you can create sort of ""mock sleeves"" if you will with the interior snaps - or go full fledged poncho if you care to. The full-length zipper is really convenient if I want to use the poncho as a lap blanket.

Initially I was thinking this piece would be sort of limited because it's really bulky, but after taking it car camping I can't believe I ever went [camping] without it. It's a really lovely companion while I sip my morning coffee, and it's super convenient during the evening. I run really cold, so I like how I can layer a light jacket underneath it without feeling like a giant marshmallow. Also, my favorite part is how it doubles as a blanket for my mini-heeler when we're cozied up by the fire.

I bought an XS and it fits perfectly - for size reference XS is in Patagonia items is pretty true to fit for me, while a size Small lends a bit of wiggle room.

Come winter, I live in my long johns - running, skiing, yoga, daily wear: you name it. I have an old-old pair of the midweight Capilene that finally had the radish, so I figured why deviate from what I know - I picked up a pair of these and I'm way impressed with the changes. 

First of all, the fabric is totally different and features a super subtle micro-grid-esque pattern on the interior that wicks away moisture before I even notice it's a problem. Perhaps the nicest part about the fabric is that it's anything but sheer, even with the form-fitting design.

As for warmth, this baselayer is way cozy. I wore them skiing on a 6-degree day and while I was roasty-toasty-cozy when I was moving, I definitely felt a bit nippy on the chairlift.

 Also, let me tell you about the waist band: it's unreal. I thought Patagonia had really hit the nail on the head when they started utilizing the wide waist band on their baselayers in 2014, but now they've really impressed me with this new edition. There's this reinforced elastic on the inside of the waistband that keeps the baselayer up high on your natural waist, which is awfully convenient if you've got a booty or a long torso. 

Bottom Line: These are an awesome midweight baselayer for someone who's looking for Jane-of-all-trades kind of performance.

As far as sizing goes I would say these run extremely true, maybe just a hair on the small side but I think more of that could be attributed to the slim fit the pants boast. ","EMPLOYEE","2017-11-02 00:00:00","I've used it several times","true"

So far, they're a great alternative to the denim. They're just as versatile as denim, if not more.  As many of the other reviewers mention, the Performance Twill is a nice option if you need to clean it up for the office, dinner, etc. (They'll get you into exclusive restaurants and clubs where denim is forbidden.) They are super comfortable - soft, with a nice bit of stretch, and seem to be durable so far. These are a great everyday pant for me, and will be in my year-round rotation.

"Patagonia","Infurno Jacket - Boys'","656650674",5,"My kids are basically outside all winter--skiing, sledding, snowman building, snowball throwing, and sometimes just going to school takes place in a blizzard. I'm not ready for them to have multiple jackets yet--a warm winter coat for school and playing, and a shell for layering when they are on the slopes, so the Inferno Jacket has been the perfect compromise. 

This jacket is lined (so soft!) so it provides an extra layer of warmth and I know it's a good jacket to send him to school in and keep him warm outside playing. But it's not too warm or bulky for an all-day ski day, and we can still layer up with a fleece underneath to ensure he's warm, or just a capilene on sunny days. 

The length is perfect and keeps snow from going up his back in even the deepest powder, and the water rolls right off. The pockets are big and perfect for stashing a few snacks and there is even a front zipper pocket--it fits his ski pass perfectly. 

This really is our go-to jacket for all our winter adventures, and you can't beat the price, especially since it's Patagonia and we know we will pass it down (and down and down) after he outgrows it.

I love the fabric; super light, sheds a drizzle, and breathes really well. However, I'm not sold on some of the fit decisions. The chest and arms are great; trim but not tight. The sleeve length could be longer and I wish they used thumb holes instead of the Arcteryx-style wrist closures. I'm used to wearing light gloves, then using thumb holes or balling up my hands and pulling the sleeves down when it gets too cold, which I can't really do with this. I'm not a fan of the hem either.

"Patagonia","Airshed Pullover - Men's","4344200",5,"First, I want to thank Backcountry.com and Patagonia for hooking me up with the Airshed to test and review. I've been running it through all types of weather to give you my thoughts on this new piece from Patagonia. Now on to the goods...

The Patagonia Airshed is far and away the most versatile shell (though it feels like a really cozy shirt) I have ever worn. One of the biggest problems I've had with many wind shells in the past is that clammy feeling you get when you start to work a little hard on those long climbs or when it gets wet from some unexpected precipitation. The Airshed seems to be in that perfect zone where it cuts the chill of the wind just enough to keep you protected and comfortable but still lets a little bit of the breeze come through. The jacket is very breathable to start with but I've found this really helps with keeping my body temp regulated on those tough long climbs when I'm really putting in effort. If I was using any other shell, I would have to take the jacket off or I'd start overheating and create a sauna-like effect in the jacket. 

Beyond it's breathability and wind-blocking ability, the Airshed does a fairly good job at protecting against the elements. On one run, it rained continuously and it wasn't until about 35-40 minutes into my run that the jacket started to give up a little and the moisture started to seep through in spots. I still had about 30 minutes to go on my run and even though the Airshed was slightly saturated, I didn't feel like I was really getting wet. I was really pleased with how it performed. 

I've worn the Airshed in temps ranging from 25-55 degrees on sunny days, rainy days, really windy days on a ridge and even in the snow. Every one of those situations, I've been pleasantly surprised at how well it performs. There is no other shell I have that I could wear in all of those situations and stay comfortable throughout. Patagonia has found the perfect blend of weather protection and breathability and somehow wrapped it up into an ultralight, really comfortable shell that feels and looks more like a shirt. An absolute home run in my book.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-27 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

What sets the Airshed apart is how versatile it is - I would say that it is ""just right"" in a wide range of temperatures due to how well it lets heat out when you start running hot. The best part is how the fabric somehow also manages to give you a nice little wind block and warmth when you need it. While this is certainly a technical piece that excels in aerobic activities like mountain biking, running, hiking, and skinning, it's understated appearance and comfortable stretch material makes it a perfect all-around piece for lower intensity activities too (I played golf in it last week and wore it to the beach on a windy day and it was perfect).

I've put around 100 miles in my Airshed and have some feedback on the top . First, I never dreamed of another top coming close to being as functional as my Houdini. Here's why I'll be wearing the Airshed on more trail runs this year than my Houdini...

The Airshed is silly comfortable against the skin. It's soft, slightly stretchy, doesn't make any noise when my sleeves brush across my body, and holy Aishshed it's breathable. More breathable and comfortable than my Houdini that's for sure. Oh, and it's also very light and packs into it's own pocket.

Fit for my sample was fairly slim, I still wore my regular medium size, but it was more comfortable with a short sleeve T underneath as opposed to long sleeve.  Some people might be psyched if they size up depending on how slim of a fit they're looking for.  
I use this as a complement to my Houdini, I always have one of them with me when I head out for a ride or run.  The Airshed is really like a stretchy breathable counterpart to the Houdini, and it self stuffs into it's chest pocket for storage.

"Patagonia","Lightweight Black Hole 20L Cinch Backpack","106312630",5,"Reader's Digest Version: I'm in love. This well-fitting, minimalist pack has just-enough storage capacity to accommodate a day's worth of necessities—without overwhelming my small frame.

Unedited Version: When it comes to daypacks, I'm mega picky. I'm short and as a result, I'm often stuck wearing packs that are way too long in the torso or too wide (as to compensate for the lack of length in the torso, yet maintain an ample storage capacity). This design flaw with other packs can prohibit my ability to navigate tricky terrain easily, or it weighs down my upper body, forcing me into a hunched over position..... and it drives me crazy. 

However, the Lightweight Black Hole Cinch is a proper daypack that actually fits well, ensuring that I'm able to navigate all sorts of terrain with ease.  The slim back panel fits my build just about perfectly, in turn allowing me to focus on the task at hand—be it biking around town, hiking, or wherever else my day takes me. 

Also—at last: the cinch top construction doesn't get in the way of my bike helmet or force me to crane in a precarious manner as I cruise around town.

I don't like using purses, so this pack is my purse if you will. I use this pack for work and play—the pack easily fits a day's worth of necessities when it comes to hiking. 

In regards to work, the generous main compartment easily fits my 15in laptop, lunch, and plenty of room leftover for other necessities.  I typically stash three granola bars and some First Aid Kit items in the internal zippered pocket so I can transition from work to the trails with ease. The zippered front pocket is great for items I need on-the-fly access to (glasses, work ID card, etc) and is deceptively deep.  

For freelance work, I've stashed a camera, two extra lenses, and a few other small addendums without any problems whatsoever. The external lash points allow me to compress the pack should I desire or I've used them as reinforcement lash points for a camera stabilization strap. 

I love the fact that the sternum strap is customizable - a great design addition for women, especially considering the fact that a great deal of packs are designed by men and don't account for certain differences in anatomy. 

All in all: if you're a short gal like me who has long struggled with the too-long or too-fat pack designs, I'd highly recommend picking up this pack. It's extremely versatile, hard-wearing, and comfortable to wear.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-07 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

When I first received this pack, I wasn't sure where it would fit in with my other bags - when exactly I would use it. I have a daypack that I like and serves me well. But after using this cinch bag a few times for going around town and some short hikes, I realized that this pack is the perfect everyday, super versatile pack that I think anyone can appreciate.

It's lightweight and stripped down build has been perfect for those quick 3-5 mile hikes when that technical pack with 15 adjustment straps just isn't needed. The comfort provided by the cushioned back panel is just enough when you're around town, lugging that 15 inch laptop to your favorite coffee shop. And the large-mouth cinch top is great for throwing/cramming/pile-driving gear and clothes in when you're in a rush to catch your flight, meet your buddies, or heading out for a weekend car camping trip.

What this bag is not is a technical, long haul daypack for hours on the trail. It's just not built for that. 

Honestly, the simplicity of this bag is the best part and what I think makes it such a versatile piece to have. That daypack that I have that was mentioned before, that used to be my go to bag. Most times, it was too much bag for those quick hikes or coffee shop occasions. This pack is just enough for almost anything you need it for, outside of being a technical daypack.

A great addition to the Black Hole line-up from Patagonia and really a sweet pack that has fit right in as an everyday pack for me.

I wear a men's size 10 running shoe, and can fit my shoes in one side. In the other I throw shorts, socks, and the Salomon 12L running vest and BOOM, I'm ready to go. Generally I'll leave this kit in my car so I can pull over and run up any hill that inspires me, but it'll also fit easily inside the large pocket of my 26L backpack that I bring to work every day. It's also great for separating my running gear (and shoes, especially), in the event I bring them on a trip and want to just throw them in a duffel or pack. No more forgetting the running shoes because they live by the door and I don't want them to nasty up my trip clothes so I'll just 'remember to grab them on the way out'. No sir. No ma'am. The whole kit lives together now, so there's no forgetting, no excuses.

I've been using the large, medium, and small cubes since this past summer for anything and everything.

For me, the Black Hole Cubes are the product that you need but you never knew you did. For example, me being a backpack and duffel person when traveling, they add a level of organization that I never thought possible. On a past trip to San Francisco for a trail race, I threw all my clothes in a duffel and had to wrap my dirty trail runners in a plastic bag to protect the rest of me clothing. My nutrition went into a zip-loc and water bottle shoved wherever I could squeeze it in. This was life before I received the Black Hole cubes. Sure, it worked but it wasn't perfect. Now, on similar ventures, my trail runners fit into the large Black Hole cube (I wear a mens size 9.5) along with my shorts, shirt, and socks for race day. My bottles, hydration vest, and nutrition get packed away neatly into the medium size and the small cube keeps my toiletries all in one place. This takes the simple duffel to a whole new level, add some respectable organization to it.

The Black Hole material is bombproof and guarantees a long life for these sweet little guys, just like any of the other Black Hole products from Patagonia. I've used mine extensively while hiking and camping - throwing them in the dirt or on the slick rock of Moab and they have held up beautifully with nary a sign of abuse.

Whether you're looking to add some organization to your duffel, use it as a carry-on, a gym bag, or keep some supplies in your car for emergency, the Black Hole Cubes have endless uses.

An abridged version of my standard review form follows after this little love letter. 

Dear Black Hole Cube, 

I just want to say: I love you. I used to put my climbing shoes in my backpack alongside my innocent post-climbing snack: an apple, its skin bare, naked, and shiny, just asking to be tarnished by the germs lurking on the bottom--nay, all over--my Miura VSs. So I clipped those shoes right onto the exterior of my backpack with a carabiner, itself a timeless and beautiful piece of gear, sadly relegated to a lowly job compared to what most carabiners get to do: save lives, partner up with another carabiner on a dog bone, etc. 

My shoes, swinging awkwardly on the outside of my bag, used to smack those unfortunate individuals to whom I came too close while making my way home. And those people on the subway with me who didn't get violated by my climbing shoes physically? The offensiveness of which we all are aware after hours, days, and months of climbing in the same pair of shoes surely affected their noses. Spiritually.

And, o, chalk, my both sweet friend and foe--you are another beast. Plastic bags, wasteful as they are, kept you at bay from exploding over everything inside my backpack, but alas, shite they have always proven to be after but a few days.

You. You sweet, sleek Black Hole Cube. You solve these problems, and continue to do so without fail. If you were a man, you would be Dani Andrada doing a perpetual pinky pull-up: burly, handsome, yet reserved in a mysterious, ""je ne sais quoi"" way.

So, mon cheri, I'm so glad you're in my life, and I'll hold onto you forever.

AHEM.

FIT: The large (10L) fits my harness, chalk bag, and shoes perfectly.

PERFORMANCE: Expect everything you've come to expect from Patagonia's Black Hole series. They're durable, burly as all get out, easy to use, handsome, and the sizes are perfect for various uses.

BOTTOM LINE: Even if you don't climb, you will find a lot to do with these cubes, and you'll have them forever. They're excellent for traveling and keeping things organized. I also use the middle-sized cube to store my camping stove and pot and fuel, and the small one for toiletries.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-10-25 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Patagonia","Black Hole Cube - Large - 610cu in","106636698",5,"I'm pretty sure Patagonia has made its mission to make my life easier. These cubes are great! I have one in every size. Organization has never been easier. I use them for vacations and grouping together those pesky smaller items that seem to disappear into the depths of my bag. I would definitely recommend these cubes to anyone who wants to make their life easier.","EMPLOYEE","2016-09-21 00:00:00","I've used it several times","true"
"Patagonia","Black Hole Cube - Large - 610cu in","656650674",5,"I'm not what you'd call an ""organized person"".....at all. I'm 33 years old and still throw all my clothes in a duffle for traveling....I don't even own a suitcase. I start out a trip with everything in it's own general area of the bag, but by two days in nothing's in it's place, and I can never find what I'm looking for without emptying the entire duffle. 

Enter Patagonia Black Hole Cubes. I didn't realize how much I was missing these in my life until I started using them this summer. They are super multifunctional and I find myself using them for everything. 

I have loved the large size for keeping small clothing (like my socks, undies, and bras) together--I can pack them all in here (it's deceivingly large) and then throw the cube in my Black Hole Duffle and feel like I am actually an organized adult!

The medium has been great for a toiletry bag--sunscreen, deodorant, hairbrush, toothpaste, facewash--I can put everything I need for a few weeks in here. I love that there are two zip pockets--I can put some necklaces/bracelets/watches in and not worry about them falling out. 

The small has been a great little bag to put some basic first aid supplies in. I keep it loaded and throw it in the car or the climbing bag. 

They are also the perfect size for loading up with snacks and putting in a backpack or dry bag so your trail mix and granola bars don't end up scattered and lost inside your pack. 

These are made to last--very durable, good zippers, and material that will easily wipe clean.

"Patagonia","Black Hole Cube - Large - 610cu in","505555921",5,"These bags are awesome, find a million different ways/reasons to use them. 

I generally use the small one for a personal toiletry bag. Also have used it as a small medical kit.

 The medium for snacks, and electronics such as camera and cell phone.

 The picture for the large doesnt do it justice. I was able to fit 12 quick draws, and PAS under one mesh side. Harness and chalk bag in the other mesh side, then close it up with my shoes inside. It easily lashes to the outside of my rope bag making storing and travelling with my climbing gear incredibly easy. 

My favorite part about having separate sturdy bags like this is you can keep them packed, then just grab and go. The nylon is durable and can repel some light snow or moisture.

Let me know if you have any questions!

"Patagonia","Capilene Midweight Set - Infant Boys'","1901174",5,"Patagonia Baby Capilene is by far our favorite baselayer for the under two crowd. The onesie and pants are made of the same capilene as the adult baselayers, and performs well. It's warmer than a standard cotton shirt, but more importantly wicks moisture away from baby. 

The onesie is key for long hikes with baby in a front pack, where your sweat can cause little ones to get wet and cold without proper clothing. 

I also love that baby capilene can be hand washed and dried overnight, so we only need 1-2 sets in each size. We layer both pieces with vests, jackets, and puff pants as weather requires.

The fit is true to a wee bit generous. My boys are tall and outgrew other brands (Carter's, Old Navy, Gap) about two months before the advertised age. They can truly wear the Patagonia outfits as described (B is 9 months old and currently in 6-12 month size). If I could make one suggestion to Patagonia it would be for a second set of snaps on the onesie for a more ""grow with you"" style.

"Patagonia","Capilene Midweight Set - Infant Boys'","711281",5,"In preparation for the recent Engearment mission to Iceland, we picked up a few extra bits to make sure our littlest gearhead, Danjo, stayed warm and dry no matter what sort of shenanigans we got up to.  The foundation of a great layering scheme is a great base layer.  And, wouldn't you know it...one of the all-time greats is available in mini sizes.  So, we had a set of the Patagonia Baby Capilene Midweight base layers delivered just in time.

The set comes with two pieces - a long-sleeve onesie and a pair of pants - and are available in six sizes for everybaby from birth to 24 months.  There's no difference between boys' and girls' sets other than the colors.  The 0-3 month size is still working for the little dude since early December at about 14 pounds, though it's starting to get small.  Patagonia rates it up to 10 lbs, but with baby sizes, everything is a total crapshoot.

We found baby Capilene to be a great foundation for a baby layering system and used the same set almost every day.  After washing, it dried quickly enough - despite a janky Icelandic dryer - that we could wash it at night and put it back on Danjo in the morning.  It also really liked to absorb liquids, so spit-up and drool made for frequent washings.  No damage from washing, so far.

There are a few features we've really appreciated.  Patagonia uses snaps that feel exceptionally solid.  When you snap the onesie together, it's not coming apart until you unsnap it.  Also, hand covers!  The sleeves have magical hand covers that fold over and keep the little ones from scratching themselves or getting cold hands.  Though we haven't tried it ourselves, Capilene must be pretty tasty because the little dude loved shoving his hands in his mouth the second we covered them.  Keep an eye out for our upcoming base-layer taste test.

Does your kid need Patagonia Capilene?  No.  But, if you plan on having the little one outside in some chilly conditions, it's a great (and adorable) way to keep them warm and dry.  Add in a set of Patagonia Baby Synchilla Booties and your nugget will be cozy and well on his or her way to being a little gearhead.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-01-08 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

Personally, not a huge fan of baggy, or super long shorts. While these are baggy and I knew it, I do feel they're marketed towards before-during-after ride. I would not wear these to work, nor would I wear them to a bar or dinner. 11.5 inch inseams, even for this 6 foot dude, are a bit too long.

They're definitely on the more athletic fitting of bike shorts, but they are super comfy and breath well. Really happy wearing them when trail riding and fit decently with the Leatt Airflex Pro kneepads underneath!

Pros:
- I love the fit. They're non baggy baggies and fit right above the knee. Athletic fit is what I'd call it. 
- The material is stretchy and breathes well. I'd also be pretty happy wearing these hiking and for casual use. I haven't had many diggers with these yet, but the material seems relatively durable. That said, if you're planning on doing bike park laps or free ride stuff, I might consider something a bit more hefty.
- The liner is pretty spot on for being a first venture to the bike apparel realm. Comfy and keeps you happy on the saddle.
- Though I don't really need to tighten the shorts up at all, the build in belt is pretty slick.
- Pocket situation is fine, two normal pockets and one zippered.

Cons:
- Only issue I've really had with them is stretching my legs out sideways - it feels just a little tight or something. Not a huge issue, only really noticeable when you're standing up to really hammer and then get back up over the saddle.

A few little things. The front pockets are comically shallow. My phone sticks out and there is no way I would carry anything in them while riding, or even just walking around for that matter. The side zipper pocket is really nice though.  Next, and this is more a comment about baggies in general. They are pretty hot.

The material itself is easy to wipe down, should my shampoo or sunscreen explode, while the generously-sized zipper easily accommodates even the largest of small necessity items (like my wallet clutch! woo, nice surprise there if you're constantly shifting between ski bag, work backpack, play backpack, and purses like I am). It's effectively the size of a dopp kit, but better material and less clunky / looks less like my husband's shaving kit, which is a nominal issue but who really wants to walk around feeling like the Bearded Lady when TSA starts rummaging through your overhead bag.

That being said, I'm the kind of gal who has a million lip balms, bobby pins, and random knick-knacks floating around in my backpack, duffle, or purse at any moment or any time, which has led to some interesting explosions within the bag. And while all those zippered pockets and whatever have come in handy, they really don't do me any good when my bag goes flying and the contents spill everywhere. So, tossing all that errant junk into the Black Hole Cube, and then shoving it into my pack / purse / duffle is definitely a breath of fresh air. Long gone are the days where I have to worry about a small container of sunscreen exploding all over my laptop or the often-dreaded ""I-Own-One-Lipstick-And-Now-My-Entire-Purse-Is-Covered-In-Its-Remnants.""  However, even if that did happen and either item exploded all over my Cube, I wouldn't be worried whatsoever since the material is easy to wipe down.

At any rate, regardless of whether you're a traveler, a knick-knack-purse-hoarder, or simply looking to streamline your life, I highly recommend the Small Cube as it's versatile, durable, and designed to make your life easier.

The medium has been great for a toiletry bag--sunscreen, deodorant, hairbrush, toothpaste, facewash--I can put everything I need for a few weeks in here. I love that there are two zip pockets--I can put some necklaces/bracelets/watches in and not worry about them falling out. 

The small has been a great little bag to put some basic first aid supplies in. I keep it loaded and throw it in the car or the climbing bag.

It easily lashes to the outside of my rope bag making storing and travelling with my climbing gear incredibly easy. 

My favorite part about having separate sturdy bags like this is you can keep them packed, then just grab and go. The nylon is durable and can repel some light snow or moisture.

"Patagonia","Capilene Midweight Crew Top - Men's","4344200",4,"First of all, thank you to Patagonia and Backcountry.com for hand selecting me to test and review the Capilene Mid-Weight crew top.

For those cool days (35-50), this top has become a center piece for me. From snowboarding to running, I have found myself wearing this shirt more than any other in my closet over the last few months. The Power Grid fabric from Polar-Tech is very comfortable, lightweight and breathable. Even on high-intensity runs, I find that it regulates my temp better than some of my running-specific long sleeve shirts. Heck, it's so comfortable that I lounge around the house in it most mornings. The thumb loops are great for ensuring no air will get into the wrist area when wearing gloves. 

Though I do really like this top, I don't know that I like the fit for what the top is supposed to be - a base layer. Yes, it fits true to size and the cut is very comfortable. The build is certainly what we've all come to expect from Patagonia - high quality of course. But being a base layer, I expected this to have a close-to-body fit. Patagonia describes the fit of this top as ""Slim fit"" but it simply is not. It fits just like a normal long sleeve. I have the Patagonia Capilene Thermal-Weight hooded top and that is also billed as a slim fit and it certainly is what I expected a slim fit to be - close-to-body fit but not too snug. Long story short, I think the cut - though it is comfortable - needs to be updated and I think if it did fit how a slim fit should, it would function as a base layer even better than it already does. 

All in all, I really do enjoy this top. Like I said, I love it so much that I tend to just lounge around the house in it because it is so comfortable. It is my go-to layer for chilly days in the outdoors whether its a relaxing hike or a high-intensity trail run. I just wish it fit a bit slimmer - like a base layer should be.

"Patagonia","Cragsmith 35L Backpack - 2136cu in","106552298",4,"I used this pack while traveling through Vietnam and Nepal for a bit over a month. I was initially hoping that I would be able to fit all my stuff into it, but it turns out I had a ton more work documents (and other random stuff) I had to haul with me, so I needed an additional bag. That said, though, if you are looking for a bag for minimalist travel or for short-term trips, this could be great. 35 L is a pretty decent size, especially for warm weather destinations. If you’re going somewhere cold, it may not offer enough space for bulky items. There’s no designated laptop sleeve, but I was able to get my MacBook Air in the back with soft items around it. The small zip pocket on the back panel will fit a passport and a few other small items. 
 
I took this on most of my flights (international and domestic) as a carry-on, so that was nice (for the flights when I couldn’t, it was because of really strict cabin weight restrictions). Minimal straps = easy to stow. The only bummer was that the waistband couldn’t be removed when I checked the bag, but it held up just fine. This bag got rained on being unloaded from a flight in Vietnam and while on top of a jeep in Nepal, but it did prove to be pretty water resistant. However, I would NOT put it out in a strong downpour, and would think about investing in a waterproof cover for it. 
 
The feature I loved most is that the back opens clamshell-style, facilitating access to stuff in the bottom of the bag. I also liked having the top load option (great for accessing stuff if you are sitting somewhere and the bag is between your legs, for example). Both of those openings have double zips, so I threw a travel lock on each of them. I really never worried about my bag being messed with because of that, which was great. 
 
For fit, this bag lived up to my expectations in terms of comfort. I am 5’3”, between 120-125 lbs., and I felt like the small pack carried well for me. I liked that there were additional straps to adjust the load where the shoulder strap met the pack, as well as where the hip strap met the pack. I found that securing the chest strap really did make a difference to distribute the weight correctly. Obviously, the back isn’t as breathable as a suspended mesh back, but for what it is, I’d say it’s done well. I carried this thing fully loaded up a small mountain and through lots of city streets. When I got back to the U.S. I took it on a day long fishing trip and hiked comfortably with it for 5+ miles. So while I wouldn’t go so far to say that it should be used for trekking, it is totally set to hike with (as it should be, taking into account its original purpose and design!). 
 
I had some Eagle Creek Specter packing cubes that I used with this and they worked great together. I was able to fit two full cubes in to form a base, and then some half and quarter cubes on top of that. If you’re into being matchy-matchy, the blue and gray are essentially the same color as this pack. 
 
Some cons:
I do wish there was a spot for a water bottle. There’s a space for an internal hydration pack, if you’re into that (I’m not always).
I did get a few stains on this pack since it was hauled through some muddy conditions and put down on the dirt. I’m not sure they will come out 100% from the gray. If that’s something that’s going to bother you, go for a darker color if you can. 
There’s one small part in the stitching that came out a few weeks into my trip. I kept my eye on it and it hasn’t gotten bigger. But it was a bummer to see that weak point on what is an otherwise sturdy bag.
If the bag isn’t fully loaded, it can be a bit floppy. There are no side straps to compress the load. 
 
Overall, this is a solid bag. I wouldn’t say it’s the BEST travel bag out there, but it is an interesting option, especially for people who also climb a bunch (double-duty!). 4 stars for what I used it for. If you are using it just for climbing purposes, check out the other reviews too.","EMPLOYEE","2017-06-30 00:00:00","I've used it several times","true"

"Patagonia","Cragsmith 35L Backpack - 2136cu in","1008463931",4,"I've been climbing more and more lately and was sick of cramming everything into my hiking daypack, so decided to try a purpose-built crag pack. Good choice! As others have noted, this one is the perfect size for a sport-climbing kit (60m rope, a dozen draws, belay devices, harness, chalk bag, and extra layers), and for bigger trad climbs, you could just carry the same stuff and let your partner haul the rack. It's also really easy to lash a static rope to the top if you need one, or move the climbing rope up there if you need to carry the rack too. (Or maybe get a more helpful partner?) Anyway, the map/guidebook pocket is handy, and the top pocket is plenty roomy for stashing wallet, keys, phone, camera, small first aid kit, and snacks. The hydration sleeve is helpful, but it works best with a small (2-3L) bladder that you can attach to the provided clip, otherwise it will slide out when you open the back. But except for dropping my 4L Dromedary (twice), I love the clamshell back opening. Super easy to load and unload and we were able to belay right out of the bag, which kept things neat and tidy. For external storage, there aren't a ton of daisy chains, but there are enough for a reasonable amount of crap like shoes, helmet, and Nalgene, and there are also little loops on the sides so you could use a cord or bungee to lash a sitting pad or whatever else onto the back if needed. Fit notes: I'm a 5'5"" woman and the small/medium fits okay, although I have to cinch most of the straps pretty tight. In my perfect world, the hip belt would be angled for those of us with actual hips, but this one gets the job done. The sternum straps are moveable, although moving them is such a pain you'll want to get it right the first time. And the shoulder straps aren't exactly contoured for those of us with curvy chests. Squishing happens, although now that I've got the sternum straps dialed in, it's not too bad—no worse than any other unisex pack. Overall, it serves its purpose well and seems sturdy enough to last a while. I'm happy.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-06-06 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

I carried a second rope out a few weekends ago and the weight and feel were just fine. It adjusts well and is plush without being bulky or stiff. 

The zipper in the back makes getting in and out in the dirt easy and I never feel it on my back.  The top access lets you use it as a rope bucket in a pinch, or to just cram stuff in a bit easier once the main bulk is in. The side pocket is a little weird because of its low volume.  The top pocket is good. 

I subtracted one star for the weird side pocket and the strange lack of outside daisy chain with some loops instead.  I just like easy to use stuff and this level of minimalism is just not intuitive to me yet and I still look around for places to hang a spare draw or sling. I don't get the loop system or what I'm supposed to hang off of it to make them useful. I'm sure I'll figure it out but...why no daisy chain? 

This really is not an alpine pack.  I would use it for long routes in Tuolumne that are all approach and rock, but not if I was carrying axes/tools, bivy gear, or a lot of weight for a long time.  This is an excellent rock climbing pack for easy to  burly day trips. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-04-21 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

- These are decently warm and are my go to layer for under my (shell) Arc'teryx Theta SV bibs for both resort and backcountry skiing. They almost run a touch hot for touring, but with the side zips on the bibs they're able to dump heat well enough.
- Wick moisture away! Can't ask for more on that.
- Have a good fit. No weird hugging in places it shouldn't.
- Long term durability seems fine. Have only used them for a season, no QC issues to speak of.

Cons:
- Being synthetic, it will pick up funky odors faster than wool. These aren't too bad, but noticeable after several days of tour (ie hut trips).

"Patagonia","Capilene Midweight Crew Top - Men's","4344200",4,"First of all, thank you to Patagonia and Backcountry.com for hand selecting me to test and review the Capilene Mid-Weight crew top.

For those cool days (35-50), this top has become a center piece for me. From snowboarding to running, I have found myself wearing this shirt more than any other in my closet over the last few months. The Power Grid fabric from Polar-Tech is very comfortable, lightweight and breathable. Even on high-intensity runs, I find that it regulates my temp better than some of my running-specific long sleeve shirts. Heck, it's so comfortable that I lounge around the house in it most mornings. The thumb loops are great for ensuring no air will get into the wrist area when wearing gloves. 

Though I do really like this top, I don't know that I like the fit for what the top is supposed to be - a base layer. Yes, it fits true to size and the cut is very comfortable. The build is certainly what we've all come to expect from Patagonia - high quality of course. But being a base layer, I expected this to have a close-to-body fit. Patagonia describes the fit of this top as ""Slim fit"" but it simply is not. It fits just like a normal long sleeve. I have the Patagonia Capilene Thermal-Weight hooded top and that is also billed as a slim fit and it certainly is what I expected a slim fit to be - close-to-body fit but not too snug. Long story short, I think the cut - though it is comfortable - needs to be updated and I think if it did fit how a slim fit should, it would function as a base layer even better than it already does. 

All in all, I really do enjoy this top. Like I said, I love it so much that I tend to just lounge around the house in it because it is so comfortable. It is my go-to layer for chilly days in the outdoors whether its a relaxing hike or a high-intensity trail run. I just wish it fit a bit slimmer - like a base layer should be.

That said, though, if you are looking for a bag for minimalist travel or for short-term trips, this could be great. 35 L is a pretty decent size, especially for warm weather destinations. If you’re going somewhere cold, it may not offer enough space for bulky items. There’s no designated laptop sleeve, but I was able to get my MacBook Air in the back with soft items around it. The small zip pocket on the back panel will fit a passport and a few other small items. 
 
I took this on most of my flights (international and domestic) as a carry-on, so that was nice (for the flights when I couldn’t, it was because of really strict cabin weight restrictions). Minimal straps = easy to stow. The only bummer was that the waistband couldn’t be removed when I checked the bag, but it held up just fine. This bag got rained on being unloaded from a flight in Vietnam and while on top of a jeep in Nepal, but it did prove to be pretty water resistant. However, I would NOT put it out in a strong downpour, and would think about investing in a waterproof cover for it. 
 
The feature I loved most is that the back opens clamshell-style, facilitating access to stuff in the bottom of the bag. I also liked having the top load option (great for accessing stuff if you are sitting somewhere and the bag is between your legs, for example). Both of those openings have double zips, so I threw a travel lock on each of them. I really never worried about my bag being messed with because of that, which was great. 
 
For fit, this bag lived up to my expectations in terms of comfort. I am 5’3”, between 120-125 lbs., and I felt like the small pack carried well for me. I liked that there were additional straps to adjust the load where the shoulder strap met the pack, as well as where the hip strap met the pack. I found that securing the chest strap really did make a difference to distribute the weight correctly. Obviously, the back isn’t as breathable as a suspended mesh back, but for what it is, I’d say it’s done well. I carried this thing fully loaded up a small mountain and through lots of city streets. When I got back to the U.S. I took it on a day long fishing trip and hiked comfortably with it for 5+ miles. So while I wouldn’t go so far to say that it should be used for trekking, it is totally set to hike with (as it should be, taking into account its original purpose and design!). 
 
I had some Eagle Creek Specter packing cubes that I used with this and they worked great together. I was able to fit two full cubes in to form a base, and then some half and quarter cubes on top of that. If you’re into being matchy-matchy, the blue and gray are essentially the same color as this pack. 
 
Some cons:
I do wish there was a spot for a water bottle. There’s a space for an internal hydration pack, if you’re into that (I’m not always).
I did get a few stains on this pack since it was hauled through some muddy conditions and put down on the dirt. I’m not sure they will come out 100% from the gray. If that’s something that’s going to bother you, go for a darker color if you can. 
There’s one small part in the stitching that came out a few weeks into my trip. I kept my eye on it and it hasn’t gotten bigger. But it was a bummer to see that weak point on what is an otherwise sturdy bag.
If the bag isn’t fully loaded, it can be a bit floppy. There are no side straps to compress the load. 
 
Overall, this is a solid bag. I wouldn’t say it’s the BEST travel bag out there, but it is an interesting option, especially for people who also climb a bunch (double-duty!). 4 stars for what I used it for.

The gear loops on outside are solid and is where I hang my shoes, helmet, and chalk, which is mostly because I don't want to stank and chalk up the inside of my pack..  I love the rear loading access and use it pretty much exclusively.  It's super easy to lay the pack down and open it up and then you have easy access to everything right there.  I've only climbed a few pitches with it on but I really enjoyed it and found it well balanced and didn't interfere with my harness at all (I'm 5'11"" and I have the small, so maybe that makes a difference).

"Patagonia","Cragsmith 35L Backpack - 2136cu in","1008463931",4,"I've been climbing more and more lately and was sick of cramming everything into my hiking daypack, so decided to try a purpose-built crag pack. Good choice! As others have noted, this one is the perfect size for a sport-climbing kit (60m rope, a dozen draws, belay devices, harness, chalk bag, and extra layers), and for bigger trad climbs, you could just carry the same stuff and let your partner haul the rack. It's also really easy to lash a static rope to the top if you need one, or move the climbing rope up there if you need to carry the rack too. (Or maybe get a more helpful partner?) Anyway, the map/guidebook pocket is handy, and the top pocket is plenty roomy for stashing wallet, keys, phone, camera, small first aid kit, and snacks. The hydration sleeve is helpful, but it works best with a small (2-3L) bladder that you can attach to the provided clip, otherwise it will slide out when you open the back. But except for dropping my 4L Dromedary (twice), I love the clamshell back opening. Super easy to load and unload and we were able to belay right out of the bag, which kept things neat and tidy. For external storage, there aren't a ton of daisy chains, but there are enough for a reasonable amount of crap like shoes, helmet, and Nalgene, and there are also little loops on the sides so you could use a cord or bungee to lash a sitting pad or whatever else onto the back if needed. Fit notes: I'm a 5'5"" woman and the small/medium fits okay, although I have to cinch most of the straps pretty tight. In my perfect world, the hip belt would be angled for those of us with actual hips, but this one gets the job done. The sternum straps are moveable, although moving them is such a pain you'll want to get it right the first time. And the shoulder straps aren't exactly contoured for those of us with curvy chests. Squishing happens, although now that I've got the sternum straps dialed in, it's not too bad—no worse than any other unisex pack. Overall, it serves its purpose well and seems sturdy enough to last a while. I'm happy.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-06-06 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

"Patagonia","Cragsmith 35L Backpack - 2136cu in","107601865",4,"First, I bought it on sale at nearly half off. At that price it is six stars.  At full price, four. IT looks like it will wear well but I've only had it out about four times now. 

I bought this to carry everything for a day for me and my daughter to climb half a day at Smith Rock or for me all day splitting gear with a partner.  It is just enough pack in volume for a 60 meter rope, 2 liters of water, shoes, harness, a rack, some sandwiches, and a layer or two.  Odds and ends in the pockets.  If I'm carrying my kid's stuff too, or more layers, It is easy to put the rope on the top of the pack and bring too much stuff.  I carried a second rope out a few weekends ago and the weight and feel were just fine. It adjusts well and is plush without being bulky or stiff. 

The zipper in the back makes getting in and out in the dirt easy and I never feel it on my back.  The top access lets you use it as a rope bucket in a pinch, or to just cram stuff in a bit easier once the main bulk is in. The side pocket is a little weird because of its low volume.  The top pocket is good. 

I subtracted one star for the weird side pocket and the strange lack of outside daisy chain with some loops instead.  I just like easy to use stuff and this level of minimalism is just not intuitive to me yet and I still look around for places to hang a spare draw or sling. I don't get the loop system or what I'm supposed to hang off of it to make them useful. I'm sure I'll figure it out but...why no daisy chain? 

This really is not an alpine pack.  I would use it for long routes in Tuolumne that are all approach and rock, but not if I was carrying axes/tools, bivy gear, or a lot of weight for a long time.  This is an excellent rock climbing pack for easy to  burly day trips. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-04-21 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

I will say the one thing that attracted me to this sling was in fact the pockets up front. Based on the pictures it appeared that I should be able get everything I normally need at my fingertips right up front. Which turned out true! A couple concerns I had prior to receiving was the possibility of the items stowed in the front falling out when you spun the vest around. That turned out not to be an issue however if you failed to close a pocket it most certainly happen. The other issue I had read was the vest not staying in position. I was so concerned with these two items I ended up ordering an Orvis Safe Passage sling at the same time. So here’s my impression of the product.
First off I have not had any issues with the vest moving horizontally or vertically what so ever. Even loaded down it stayed right where I wanted it to. So not sure what the other folks are doing that would cause unwanted movement? Also the pictures show the front pockets high on your shoulder. You are able to adjust this so that the front pockets come across you’re for chest for easy access as well as staying clear from your casting arm. I can only say that I absolutely love this vest and it does everything I needed to do and more!! Very comfortable and easy to access!  I think the only thing I could see that should be changed is installing a couple drain holes in the bottle holster at the bottom of the vest.  Being that is the closet to water it could hold water if one were wading in deep water. I purchased the blue only because I felt it may stay a bit cleaner than the tan. And by the way I did return the Orvis Safe Passage.

The only negative I can find on this bag is the occasional need to adjust it on my shoulder as it can feel like it is slipping off.  It obviously won't slip off because of the straps securing it to you, but probably because of the weight distribution it needs an occasional slide back on to the spot I like it to sit.

Quality: These are made for lots of use. They are the only ski pants I have ever had that I don't end up cutting up the bottoms on my edges. They don't look worn at all after a full season of use, even in the Goldenrod color, which is light and awesome looking. 

Waterproof: I tested these in pretty much the harshest environment for moisture....The Cascades. I've never had these soak through, which is a first. They were solid when I had to teach ski lessons all day in solid downpour rain. 

Warmth: These are super warm without being bulky. I was skeptical of having insulated pants at first, but am super glad to have these. It's great to be able to sit on the snow and not be cold. 

Fit: I am 5'5"" and around 130. Small fits great. 

Area for improvement: The only thing I would change on these is the button at the top. I think it would be better with some sort of clasp that can't pop open.

The Synchilla fleece is fuzzy to the touch, warm for Cool weather wear and is a good midlayer under a jacket or shell for warmth though it is bulky. The sleeves are somewhat short as it extends barely to my wrists and does pull up when arms are extended. The pullover does pull up as well when you lift your arms.

Some issues you may encountered:
1. It 's true to size but does shrink over time esp. if using low heat in dryer
2. The fleece slowly gets harder over time so try not to wash with harsh detergents to help slow that though dryer on low dry setting does help
3. It does NOT BLOCK OUT THE WIND! It's the SAME thing with many North Face fleece! The wind WILL CUT THROUGH the fleece.
- In cool or warmer temps, it's not much of an issue esp. in warmer areas.
- But when you wear it as an outer layer during COLDER temps and there's a chilly wind, You WILL freeze! You'll find out if you live in New England with chilly arctic air weather conditions.
- Patagonia obviously has Not made its Synchilla fleece dense to block out the wind.

It's pretty much a perfect piece. Incredibly soft, and I mean incredibly, on the skin side. The super soft fleece touches the skin, while the outside is brushed smooth like a sweater.

I recommend getting in an every day color like grey, navy, black. That way, you can wear it anywhere and everywhere. Personally, I don't take mine camping or hiking, it is a bit heavy for that, thought performance wise there's no question it's burly and technical enough to keep you warm without getting trashed in the bushes. Mine is more of an around town piece, from work to the movies to the coffee shop... airports to libraries to Christmas morning.

the fleece inner-lining keeps you extremely warm and is baby bottom soft. the quarter zipper is long and this is easy to pull on and off unlike some others (spyder) that are tight under the arm. the two tone color is fun, and the zip pocket on the chest is easy to access and plenty large enough for a phone and small wallet.

It is snug across the bottom.  Also, I'm a petite, so the length is down to the widest part of my butt (actually down to the top of my thighs), which may be part of the problem.  
The cochineal is a rusty red. 
The permeability means that some wind does come through.  It seems about 90% wind resistant.

I like it a lot but may have to shorten it in order to fix the fit issue.    Also I have an ongoing gripe about zippers going up to the chin.  I do not have a short neck (according to my fit on a cervical collar) but the zipper seems to be in the way of my chin.  Also the 'stacked zipper' problem once you start layering things becomes annoying.  Please, designers, change the zipper design at the collar.
Finally, I like it at the $100 price point, although it doesn't really have enough functionality to qualify as a good value at that price (one-way zipper only, no hood, not waterproof, zipper not waterproof, no adjustable or inner cuffs).

It's the best warmth to weight ratio you can find, and I always pack it with me when I'm camping or backpacking, regardless of the conditions. It packs down teeny tiny and can save the day if cold temperatures hit. I like that this version does not have a hood, because it can also transition to my midlayer insulation when skiing without adding extra bulk behind my head.

My dad also noticed how much I wear and love this jacket, that he requested one for Christmas, which he now enjoys just as much as I do. He says it's a great casual jacket that provides the perfect amount of warmth.

"Patagonia","Down Sweater Jacket - Men's","108429654",5," I originally decided to buy the down sweater without the hood for layering under my shell but I've found that I've ended up wearing it around town and for running errands more than skiing. The cold days I did wear it skiing I was very glad I had it, especially those really chilly days when I was sitting on the lift. I'd probably use a down vest a little more for skiing than the down sweater, just because I tend to be a little warmer in the upper body than others. Besides skiing this has been my ""go to"" jacket from  November to March, these northern Utah winters can be cold. The down sweater is very light and comfortable, easy to layer or wear by its self. It's obvious to me why this jacket has so many great reviews, extremely versatile, lightweight and comfortable. Plus it all packs into a single pocket and doesn't take up much space. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-28 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Patagonia","Down Sweater Jacket - Men's","107901349",5,"I was on the fence about this jacket. I really did not like how flimsy and thin the ultralight version was but I wanted a great down jacket that was also as light as possible. I was torn between this one and another jacket by another brand that was about 4 ounces lighter. I opted to buy both for maximum flexibility and choice. I realize this is not always an option (and the first time I have done this myself), but I could have stuck with the Down Sweater, to be honest.

I sweat, I do not perspire. With that means that I cannot wear down jackets when I am working hard and sweating (even with down treatment). For me, the down jacket is for cold nights at camp after I have cooled down and am not swimming in my sweat.

I have already taken this jacket out a couple of times and I love the weight and packability. I purchased a 3L dry sack (because I live in the PNW) and found that in the dry sack this jacket packs down smaller than in its own pocket stuff sack. The jacket sat beautifully in the bottom of my pack without taking much space until lunch time when, after a full morning of rigorous snowshoeing, I needed to let my mid layer dry off a bit. I was warm within minutes in this jacket, fresh out of the stuff sack. The jacket puffed up quickly and I was actually overheating and had to vent the jacket after 10 minutes.

This jacket is also much more rugged than the ultralight version. This may not be as much of a deal for some as it is for me but I want a jacket that can withstand me and my less than graceful ways and accidents. I also tend to push my gear hard.  I have also worn it out around town a couple of times and it blocks the wind enough to keep me warm but also lets enough in that I am not cooking inside (which happens a lot). Please keep in mind that I run warmer than most.

If I had a complaint (which is not enough to effect my rating of the jacket), it would be that the cut is a little on the generous side. I wear a large in most brands unless they run small and usually, with a couple layers on, a large will fit over everything with little room to spare. I am not super slender or overly muscular but I also do not have a midsection either. This jacket is almost too generously cut for my liking. There is no question that you can layer plenty underneath this jacket and it will still feel comfortable. With a t-shirt or a couple light layers, this jacket is very roomy. This could be good for some but maybe not for others. I rated the jacket as true to size but some may consider the jacket to run large.

Needless to say that this jacket, despite the extra 4 ounces, is worth it to me over the ultralight version. It looks good both around town and keeps you warm in the backcountry. A great all around jacket. And Patagonia's views on the environment make it one of the few companies that I purchase gear from.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-27 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

-Well placed big pockets
-Sizing is right on (im a pretty standard 36 and the 36 fits great) and there is also an adjustment feature that i have not used, but it works to cinch them down a little
-Sturdy belt loops made of webbing

These are extremely soft and feel so good. While I only just received mine, I'm sure the quality will be as amazing as my other Patagonia items. The pockets are deep enough that you can actually fit things in, the cuffs are wide to stay put if you roll them, and the spandex makes for a comfortable waistband that doesn't dig into you. 

I would be cautious of sizing down however.  I'm 5'7 with a very athletic body; I have hips and a butt and I live for comfy pants. Based off many reviews, I  bought  a medium. I'm not disappointed, but I should have know better since a majority of the reviews were from petite woman..

The mediums are fitted through my thighs, with a big of room in the waist (which is a good thing). They aren't too tight and I can move around in them just fine, but they definitely don't sit on me like they do on the model up there in the photos. 

I'm not sure what kind of sweat pants the other reviewers have worn, but sweat pants are suppose to be baggy. That's the whole point of them.  A better suggestion than ""size down"" is to size based off what style you want. The normal baggy feel, regular size. A more form fitted style, size down.

I have the Down Shirt, but needed something warmer and did not want to wear my bulky ski jacket on other outdoor activities. I originally ordered this in a small because my Down Shirt is a small. The small fit too tight around my hips and was a little squished in general so I exchanged for a medium. I took the medium out that day snowshoeing and immediately realized that it was way too big and bunched in the torso area making it awkward to carry a backpack with the chest and waist straps clipped. It was also incredibly warm, which is awesome for a stroll outside, but not so great when hiking a bit of elevation, or doing some snowshoeing in a little powder; I overheated and had to unzip most of the way. With that being said, I live in Colorado where even a 10° day can feel like spring if the sun is shining and there's no humidity in the air. I really loved the look, color, and quality of this jacket (and figured I could live with the hot-box warmth), so I decided to switch back to the size small. I went to the store to exchange once again, and while there, I ended up trying on the hooded Down Sweater (small) and found that the fit was different, but perfect. The Down Sweater is a tad bit shorter than the Hi-Loft, and cuts in slightly at the torso reducing the ""bulge/bunching"" in the stomach area. I have a thin upper body, but a wider hip and bum area which is why the longer Hi-Loft jacket just wasn't fitting right.

However, the one qualm I have is that there is only one exterior pocket, and that pocket becomes increasingly inaccessible the more the main pack gets filled with stuff, as it doesn't actually expand beyond the dimensions of main pack. This makes getting my wallet in and out somewhat fussy and annoying, whereas if there was just a nice little side pocket that I could reach back and get into nice and easy, then I'd be giving this 5 stars.

This one was on great sale so I bit.  I am ALWAYS a medium in Pataguchi, but I returned this.  I have a couple of observation for you if you're considering this one from the big P.  

First, this jacket has an awkward fit  - the body is boxier than a normal Patagonia and the sleeves shorter.  The room in the midsection is not really a big issue and to be expected with a  down jacket.  While there was this room, the cut of the jacket was still that Patagonia quality so it wasn't like wearing a bag from Columbia or Marmot.  Biggest issue and reason for the return was the sleeves.  Easily a full inch shorter that I have ever seen on a jacket form this brand.   

The goods -   Its lower hem length makes it a good stand-alone.  I could also get my shell over it without compressing the down.  The hood is deluxe.  While down its like your that guy walking around the airport with his travel pillow around is neck.  It is Hi-Loft after all.   

Im 6' and 180 lb.  43 chest, 33 waist ( narrowest part of my torso )  I always run a medium in Patagonia and Arc'teryx.  I prefer a closer, more athletic fit.  Bummed this one didn't work out.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-05-20 00:00:00","",""

"Patagonia","Hi-Loft Hooded Down Sweater Jacket - Men's","106622811",5,"I was born and raised in Minnesota winters. When I first moved to Utah, I was able to wear whatever I wanted during the winter. I had a lightweight Rab puffy that did just fine in any conditions. As I started to acclimate to the desert, the winters began to feel colder. This year I finally decided to search for a heavier puffy for around town and apres ski. 

I searched through lots of coats, and luckily stumbled upon this one. After trying it on the first time, I knew it was the winner. The coat is simple and does not have any gimmicks. The baffels are solid, the pockets are ideally placed and roomy, the hood is insulated well, and the drawstrings at the waist and hood work well.  The elastic sleeve cuffs are the correct tension and keep the weather out without cutting your circulation off.
Some days, the jacket is too much warmth and I have to unzip it or strip it off. Most days I am thankful for how comfortable I am in it. 

Recently, I broke my back and have been restricted from driving and doing anything athletic. This coat fits over my brace and is perfect for my walks to the grocery store or around the neighborhood. There are slight cold spots around the shoulders, but that is typical for down jackets and is not noticeable in most conditions. This jacket doesn't pack down ultra small and isn't the lightest option, but if you want an affordable and very warm winter coat for everyday life, you cannot go wrong with the Hi-Loft. 

I am 6'0"" and about 155 lbs. I purchased the Large originally, but felt it had too much room that wasn't necessary. I went the the Medium and it fits perfect for my style and needs. 

One thing that that slightly annoyed me was that since the hood is so insulated, it sits very large behind your head when you aren't using it. I guess that is a sacrifice for the warmth though and other people might not even notice it. 

Pictured is me in my back brace messing around in my truck. I like how low profile this is for such a warm coat.

Only things I would change in this coat is 1)the draw cord to cinch the waist should tuck away somewhere, maybe inside the pocket, but right now it just hangs down8"", so I tied it in several knots to get it out of the way.   2) Zippers.  It doesn't happen often, but occasionally the zippers catch the fabric and get jammed up.  This was way worse on my older down coat though.

 I just came out of a four day hut trip in British Columbia where it was around freezing and snowing everyday, everything was soaked by the end of the day. Even after four hard days of sweating my ass off breaking trail, dropping pillows, and chopping firewood this shirt was fantastic. It dried super quick, kept me warm, and the smell was tolerable after days of use. If you are thinking about giving capilene another try, or looking to get your first piece; do it. I have the peppergrass color and it looks pretty good with my ginger beard. The color is insanely bright. SAR won't have any issues finding you if shit hits the fan. 

The thumb loops rule, super minimal and help keep the shirt tucked into gloves and under other layers. 

the mid-weight features a great waffle print fabric that is the perfect weight for most mild winter conditions.

"Patagonia","Ultralight Down Jacket - Men's","2104585795",5,"Weighing in at 9.5 oz, this is truly an ultralight jacket, not to mention a warm one. The 800-fill goose down traps body heat very well, and I found myself comfortable in temperatures down to the low teens. It also packs down small so it fits nice and compact in your pack.

While it does have a DWR coating that works reasonably well, you'll definitely want a shell over it if the heavens do open up...it is still down after all, and wasn't really designed with heavy duty waterproofness in mind. As an insulating mid layer or outer layer on clear cold days, however, you can't go wrong.

The fit is near perfect, at least for me. The cut is such that you can wear a thin baselayer underneath and still wear your shell over it. I also like that the logo isn't large or in-your-face...kind of a pet peeve of mine. (Don't get me wrong, I don't mind logos on gear, I just prefer them to be subdued and not screaming at you.)

I'll admit, I was a little hesitant to spend the money on something that says Patagonia on it, but I'm glad I did. The Ultralight Down Jacket has become one of my favorite cold-weather pieces for my outdoor adventures, and should last a good long time. I highly recommend it!

PROS: Warm, lightweight, packs down small, looks good, logo is not in-your-face

This layer is the perfect weight for even the hottest desert runs and has dried remarkably quickly. Not much else to say about it other than it works perfectly, looks great and is fun to wear.

Make sure to wash it frequently to keep its wicking abilities at their best and to keep the stink at it's lowest. I generally just hand wash it while I'm in the shower and let it dry for the morning.""

"Patagonia","Capilene Lightweight Short-Sleeve T-Shirt - Men's","107901349",5,"I have been focusing on my base layers this year with aspirations of controlling how sweaty I get. I sweat, I do not perspire! Therefore, I needed good first layers to move moisture away from my body both when I am hiking and when I am running. I purchased two short-sleeved lightweight and two long-sleeved shirts, one light weight and one midweight. I have been mostly running but I have gotten out a couple times snowshoeing with these.

For all activities that I have used them for they have been excellent. They do soak up sweat but they also get rid of it very quickly, even with additional layers over top. As the only layer when I am running they are saturated in some places but much less so than other shirts I typically run in (I live in the PNW and it is still very humit as of writing this review). In fact, they are so good that I have been running in the capilene shirts almost exclusively since I purchased them (about 5-6 weeks)

The first thing you'll notice is that this shirt, even the midweight, is extremely thin. Typically I only wear a shirt or shorts once and then wash it. However, after a couple of washings of these shirts, I noticed that they had signs of wear. There were little snags and distortions in the fabric. I began to worry that these would not last long enough to make them worth the cost. I thought about buying several more to lighten the burden but then decided to do a little testing first. Since these shirts are treated with polygene they should not stink as much as a typical polyester. So I wore one shirt for two weeks running 4 times per week and hang drying it after rather than washing. I ran once in a standard poly shirt and let it hang dry for the two weeks as a control. The standard poly, as you can imagine, stunk after a couple of days. The capilene got a little funky but not unbearable. Even better, when I start to sweat in a standard poly that already has the funk, it stinks even worse when it gets wet; not the polygene capilene. Though they were a little funky, they never got worse even resoaked in my sweat the following day. I then decided that I would repeat the test but rinse the shirts after each run in my post-run shower. This time there was a slight funk but barely noticeable (and no complaints from the wife which is the real test).

In the end, I decided not to purchase any more shirts but instead wash the shirts much less than my typical running stuff. Because the shirts are so thin, I rinse them in my post-run shower and they are dry and ready by morning for the next run. This cuts down on the number of washes and will, in theory, increase the longevity of the shirts.

Amazing shirt and, in a way, cuts down on washing and waste as a result. When I need another one I will be purchasing another one of these shirts without thinking twice.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-27 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

Lightweight is an understatement, the fabric is so light and thin you feel like the tag, which is thankfully not placed behind the neck, is as heavy as the rest of the shirt. 

This piece works great as a standalone piece in hot weather and as a base layer in cooler weather.

"Patagonia","Down Sweater Vest - Women's","109566852",5,"I bought this vest as part of my cold weather ski get up. This is an essential piece in properly layering for frigid ski days.

I start with a merino base layer (Mons Royale long sleeve turtleneck), then the Patagonia Better Sweater 1/4 zip in an XS. Then this down vest on top in a S. Last, the North Face shredromper bib pants and the North Face Anorak shell on top. You're guaranteed to stay warm that way.

The reason I opted for a down vest over a down jacket is for breathability and temperature control. Down can get wet and cold if you get too hot and sweat, so it's important to use it wisely in insulating and a vest is the perfect balance between staying warm but not getting over-heated.

I love the fit of this vest. It pairs so nicely with so many other pieces and adds incredible warmth to the right areas.

ohhhh these pants are amazing.

The 28's though were everything i've dreamed about... they are soft, and stretchy but don't look like jeggings. The back gaps only slightly in the back but the front part of the waist fits perfectly. Also, i love the dark color of them. I can wear them climbing, walking, or to work for a full 12 hour day and still be comfortable when I get home. I'm 5' 7"" and they are definitely long...

So, I picked up a 24 and while they were initially pretty tight, they weren't necessarily uncomfortable to begin with. However, with consistent wear, they did stretch out a little, which gave my hips a little more breathing room than my initial impressions - without bagging out in the knees all weirdly (which is a huge selling point for me, personally). For fit reference, I wear a 24 / 25 in Gap denim, 25 in JCrew, and a 00 in Prana. All of my running bottoms and baselayers from Patagonia are all XS.

I was really excited to get my hands on these and see what improvements Patagonia made with their new line of base layers. I've been using an old pair of Patagonia base layer bottoms for the last 3 ski seasons and I love them. In fact, it's really the only base layer bottom I've used and needless to say, they are showing signs of wear. With these it  was no surprise to find that Patagonia has made an already awesome product into something better.

The fit is spot on for me and the cut is just so comfortable. I lounge around the house in these, sleep in them while camping, and of course use these for skiing/snowboarding and any other cold weather activity. Just the perfect all around bottoms. The fabric is so cozy with the interior being fleece (just like the Thermal Weight Top http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/productLanding.jsp?productId=PAT00VN&contentIdSocial=review-atg542906) and it does an outstanding job of breathing to regulate body temp. I have not once over-heated in these babies no matter the activity. 

I think the only thing I would like is for them to fit a little more snug but this is more of a personal preference. Overall, these do what they are suppose to and do it well. Even when the temps are in the single digits, these keep me warm on any adventure.

My recent outing was below freezing  26f and windy(I know this isn't cold to some, but in a stop-go-stop go with lots of  ""hurry up and wait"" work environment 26f will get to you) this kept my legs comfortably warm.
They dry quick enough, much better than old school non-grid fleece, 
Polygiene does work well and sets Patagonia apart from other grid-fleece base layers. This is the reason why I prefer patagonia.

The Bad: "" has a smooth face for easy layering"" isn't all that true with these, it  will still ""grab"" your mid-layer if it isn't slick.inside.  I would not recommend for non-stretchy  pants. The material waive is subject to ""runs"" (think pantyhose runs) (-½ star) 
 Patagonia decided to add extra advertising to the waistband, men's underwear are already billboards with the company's logo or name all over them as it is so I generally discourage this in my ratings, the Patagonia capilene thermal weight isn't too bad about this so I will leave it a smaller hit (-½ star) 

The ugly: This is were I have a bone to pick with Patagonia with their new capilene series. Patagonia has seemed to developed some serious inconsistency/ quality control issues in the last/sizing. Try buying 5 pairs of the same size and try each one on, they will all fit very differently! I purchase a size medium and when I got mine, they seemed to fit okay, but the waistband was for a size large pair. It didn't feel snug at all around my 33"" waist but the rest was okay. Luckily I found out there was a local Patagonia store near me that was willing to exchange them. Tried on a pair there and was perfect, but was curious and tried another pair or the same size and weight and felt like a small-medium (really tight around my thighs). I did this with their mid-weights too, tried on a few pairs,  they have the same issues too (.-1star)

As for the coat itself, it is VERY warm.  I wear it daily on my commute in Chicago.

"Patagonia","R3 Hooded Fleece Jacket - Men's","105713282",4,"The Patagonia R3 Hoody was a gift to me this Christmas, which means this early review is one of initial impressions. 

For those who think TLDNR: This is Patagonia's softest, most comfortable, and warmest fleece. That's the truth. 

By accident, I have accumulated (in 10 years) two R1 fleeces (full zip and a hoody), one R2, and now this, the R3 full zip hoody. 

Each has a defined use: The R1 Hoody for technical climbing and spring skiing. The R1 full zip (no hood) is for layering, or casually wearing to the office.

My original R2 (the first R series fleece I owned) is used for extraordinary cold days skiing, climbing, or mountaineering. Since it is my oldest, and the most frayed of my fleeces (10 years of skiing and sitting too close to a wood stove will do that!), it doesn't get much use going out to the pub or worn to work. 

And now I have the R3, which bridges the gap between being the perfect fleece to wear for business casual, as well as a warmer than hell layer for your coldest outdoor activities. 

Be warned, this fleece, in spite of comfort and light weight, is amazingly warm. You will get roasted in this fleece if you are doing high octane activities in a Rocky Mountain temperature range (say, 10-30 degrees.)

 It's not a layer for bump skiing or ripping through chopped up powder––Patagonia's Nano-Air Hoody is a much better layer for that (particularly when paired for a shell.) 

What this fleece does supremely well is when you're less active, such as belaying, chilling (literally) on a chairlift, or climbing in supreme wind chill conditions. It's a fantastic ""end of day"" fleece when you're at home, beer in hand, watching Netflix and hanging out with your girl and golden retriever. You can wear this over a t-shirt and be supremely comfortable. 

This fleece also looks absolutely bitchin when worn out to the local brew pub on a snowy evening with your friends. It's tapered well and is universally flattering. It's bound to get ""Patagucci"" comments flung at you––and that's a good thing, cause the ladies love a well dressed Patagucci guy ;)  

The only thing that prevents this from being a 5 star fleece is the waist––I'm a slender guy, and I feel like it tapers a bit aggressively there––it could be a fraction longer. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-04 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

"Patagonia","R3 Hooded Fleece Jacket - Men's","3566287",5,"I got one of these recently on a whim because I read INCREDIBLY good reviews on many sites, including here.  The write-ups described a redesigned, well thought out piece that was incredibly versatile.  Patagonia, in my experience, builds solid stuff that tends to be conservatively designed (for example, the venerable R2 layer has not changed that much over the years except some cosmetic changes and some fit changes).  The R2 is a workhorse for me and having a similar weight jacket, with a HOOD would be a real plus for me.  

Unlike other Patagonia items, this R3 was COMPLETELY redone.  I had two R3's before and they were too bulky, too warm, and just not ideal for my needs in Utah and too heavy to bring back east for a visit.  Folks here rightfully gripe if they thought at this R3 was going to be the same weight as before, but for me this hits the spot.  

Unlike its forebears, this R3 is retooled, rethought, and really updated.  The fabric weight is the same, maybe a bit lighter, than the R2.  Warmth, at least for me, has been the same.  The hood is a really nice feature.  Comfy, good fit, and usable.  Hoods do make a big difference for me--when traveling and sitting outside on the porch.  The fabric weight is MUCH lighter than the older R3.  This means it is WAY more versatile.  Big plus.  

Now the big changes.  This is two coats in one.  One side has hand pockets that are JUST right in size and placement.  I've found that I naturally put my hands there and they feel right where they belong.  The one Napoleon pocket on this side is zipped to secure items.  This is your casual, lounger jacket that could easily double for skiing, hiking, camping, or around town.  

Flip it inside out and you have a very nice technical fleece with two chest pockets allowing you to wear a pack or harness.  

It fits PERFECTLY.  As others have said, you either put it on and keep it on when you get it or you immediately send it back because it is not what you thought it was.  For me I knew what I was getting and am so thrilled to have a piece that doubles as two jackets and is so versatile.  It combines the ""informal "" hoody for the fire at night with the technical layer you need for the day's adventures.  Wow.  

That said, this is a first run of this design and there are some minor changes I would want to see.  First, the hip pockets are NOT zipper shut.  Minor gripe, but the idea of having FIVE pockets that were zippered was a great idea for a fleece jacket.  Most have two if not three max.  Five means good storage, but only put granola bars in the hip pockets or something not needed if it pops out.  

Second, I agree with folks that the (larger) double zipper does indeed feel uncomfortable against your face.  Patagonia does provide a double flap to cover it, but it needs to be a bit bigger.  This issue is easily solved by just unzipping the zipper a little bit.

The roll over top is great, but to make them fit the way that feels right, the fold over covers the opening to the two front pockets. Not really a big deal since I don't see them being useful outside of an aesthetic for the pants. If you only rolled them down as much as seen in the picture, the crotch would be like weirdly low. I need to pull them up so I don't feel like the crotch is in a weird spot that restricts movement. I'm 5'1"" and 110lb. and got the xs, which are very comfortable. If they made an xxs, those would likely be fine too, and slimmer in the leg. I'm not sure how these (the xs at least) would fit a girl much taller than 5'3""-5'4""... For a short person I've got a pretty standard inseam at 30"", and I feel like they're just the right length so that I can wear them all the way down or fold the bottom cuff once and have both ways look good. I definitely recommend the carbon color as well - its a nice change from black or grey, but is still surprisingly neutral enough to match anything. Plus, they can make the leap to a more polished outfit in that color.

"Patagonia","Nano-Air Light Hybrid Insulated Jacket - Women's","656650674",5,"I am pretty much Goldilocks when it comes to body temp--I have  a hard time finding a happy balance between too hot and too cold. I have been pulling out this jacket for the last several months for all different weather conditions. 

Cold Temps:  When I'm running in the cold, I heat up pretty quickly, and often find myself overheating in 20-30 degree runs in most jackets. I've tried every combination of layers but if the sun is shining I usually end up too warm and sweaty--even in two feet of snow. I honestly don't understand how this jacket breaths and vents like it does--but it makes it extremely comfortable to run in cold temperatures. With 20-30 degree temps I was comfortable with just a tank and this piece--it keeps my core warm, and my armpits breathing, with NO overheating and no sticky soggy layers--where does all the moisture go??! I have no idea how it works, but it does!

Rain: I have worn this jacket in light to medium rain/sleet/ hail/ snow, and literally watched the moisture bead up and roll right off. It's so breathable, it doesn't offer up the same wind protection as something like the Houdini or Airshed, but for running in moisture it has been great.

Summer climbing: We love to head up high to beat the summer temps, but again, since I'm Goldilocks, I tend to be cold standing in the shade belaying ,or early morning climbs before the sun hits the wall. I love this jacket because it's super comfortable, allows for full range of motion, and I can belay and climb without having to take my jacket off--I don't heat up too much when I start to climb.

Fit/Features: This jacket does run a bit larger than other Patagonia jackets--it's more of a relaxed fit. I love the thumbholes on the sleeves, and this jacket does a pretty good job fending off the stink--I really can't remember the last time I washed it. I was nervous with how soft it is that it wouldn't do well against the rocks, but I've climbed in it and there is no wear at all.

"Patagonia","Nano-Air Light Hybrid Insulated Jacket - Women's","106312630",5,"Where do I even begin? I'll try to take it easy on the modifiers, but it's going to be a tremendous challenge!

Back in 2014, the Nano Air completely changed the way I approached layering, not to mention how I viewed synthetic insulation. It was warm both as a standalone piece or layered underneath a shell. It could be worn through wet and dry weather alike and it was so breathable that I didn't have to take it off. That being said, I did have some qualms with the Nano Air: while the fabric pilling was entirely cosmetic, it at times drove me crazy, however more frustrating the jacket (despite its breathable and lightweight constitution) was almost TOO warm at times - especially those when I was really putting the proverbial pedal to the metal. I wanted an insulation layer that had the same, dependable performance as the Nano Air but with a little bit more breathability for my high-output adventures. And obviously, I wasn't the only one who was seeking this kind of layer. 

So who would have thought that Patagonia could possibly out-do themselves by creating a layer that again totally revolutionizes the way I approach layering? Well, they did and yet again, I am totally blown away by the performance and innovation of the Nano Air Light Hybrid jacket. 

I typically wear the Nano Air Light Hybrid while running in cold conditionsÃ¢ÂÂboth road and trail, however I've also worn it resort skiing, hiking, and around town. I've largely been able to gather the effectiveness of the jacket's new technology while running, as its when I sweat the most, yet require core warmth. To say the least, it's been a highly effective midlayer / standalone piece. I will say, when I've worn it skiing, I've been cold on the chairlift, but once I get moving it's incredibly cozy. I typically wear the Nano Air Light Hybrid layered atop a lightweight merino wool baselayer and that seems to be the best methodology of layering for me. Or, should I need extra warmth, I pair it with the Merino Air and that seems to be more than sufficient.

Starting with the easy stuff: the pilling issue seems to be completely absolved. The fabric seems to have a little bit more of a hardy constitution that is less inclined to pill. That being said, I've had the Nano Air Light Hybrid less than a year and my Nano Air is going on 3 years of heavy-duty use, so it's no surprise that I have yet to see any pilling occur.

Okay, now onto the technical stuff: the knit panels are the stuff of legends. This is exactly the change that needed to be madeÃ¢ÂÂwhen I start to warm up, the knit panels seem to preemptively pull the moisture away from my baselayer and push it to the outside of the knit panels (in turn drying quickly and ensuring that I remain comfortable), not to mention the knit panels are innately breathable, so I'm able to regulate my temperature with minimal effort. 

Meanwhile, the Full Range insulation is still as mobile, breathable, and lightweight as ever. The core panels (combined with the lining) safeguard my precious body heat, and the insulation at the top of the sleeves and shoulders not only provides warmth, but also protects me from moisture, wind, and precipitation (which, if you've ever had cold or/and wet arms before, you know it's not fun). Not to mention, the extra DWR treatment is really convenient, though its performance is relatively self evident.

As for the subtle design features: the thumbhole cuffs are awesome. That might be one my favorite features of this jacket - and for once, they're at the right length! I've long struggled with Patagonia's thumbholes, but I don't have a problem with these. 

Regarding the fit: I have a Small and it seems to fit slightly relaxed on me. Albeit it's incredibly comfortable and I still have unimpeded mobility, however I'm sort of in-between an XS and Small with Patagonia's fit model. So I can go with either size. All in all, I'm sold on this jacket and I highly (bigly) recommend it to folks looking for a breathable, insulated layer.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-02-01 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

To give you an idea of the winter here, I'm writing on November 21 and it's -7F outside. This jacket is warm and comfortable, even down to these chilly temps! 

PROS:
- Inside collar (where your chin goes when it's all zipped up) pockets, and sleeve cuffs are lined with super soft suede-like fabric that doesn't catch when your hands get chapped (because eew, that's the grossest feeling ever) 
- Top zipper is covered so it doesn't make your face cold
- Collar is super puffy and keeps your neck warm
- Waterproof fabric on shoulders / chest / back is nice if it's wet out, even though the regular fabric holds its own against water pretty well
- Dropped hem on the back is nice for keeping you covered if you're bending over
- Sizing is great, fits very well
- Sleeves are lined with silk so your long sleeve shirts don't get all bunched up when you put them on

CONS:
- My fiance grumbles because now he can't get the men's version
- If you get the jacket you probably won't get the vest, which is a bummer
- It does show white dog hair, but it's easy enough to remove with a lint roller

The stark differences are the fit, the Triolets being much narrower, the full sealed side zips that allow you to take off the pants without taking off your boots in place of the vents, and the elastic waistband with a built-in belt. I love the way these fit as I can't stand hiking backcounty with baggy fitting pants, but a huge disclaimer, they fit super tight in the cuff if you're wearing pure alpine ski boots and not touring or tele boots. Most of the fabrics are identical to the Primo, except the pants are sectioned such that the calf & quad quarters of the pant are a slightly lighter weight fabric than the shin and the butt/hamstring. The kick patch are made out of the same material as the Primo, but lack the inch-high cuff.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2011-11-30 00:00:00","",""

I have a couple of courier/messenger bags already but needed one that would fit my new 15"" (15.6"") HP laptop as well as my notebooks. I chose this bag (the 24L) for the size as well as my extensive history with gear and clothing from Patagonia. The overall size is great and it looks nice. There you go, those are the benefits. The material is chinsy and flimsy, only a Macbook will fit in the computer slot, the shoulder strap has very little adjustment and the pad on the strap is large and flat making it dig into your neck. I'm working on a stabilizing strap because the fabric is so slippery it slides all over the place when you're riding a bike or motorcycle. The strap connection to the bag is placed at such a poor angle that its clear no real design time was spent on the product. A stabilizing strap would alleviate many of this bags problems but because of the bag/strap design its incredibly hard to make one that works well. I have bags from Aerostitch, Canyon Bags, and Mountain Hardware (to name a few) and they are all head and shoulders above this.

"Patagonia","Dirt Craft Bike Shorts - Women's","656650674",5,"I have just got into biking the past few years and have pretty much hated trying to find clothes to ride in. I'm not built like your typical buff biker chic, so I always felt like I was swimming in bike shorts--and had yet to find something that was actually comfortable. 
I was able to snag these for a killer price at an outlet sale, and I've been wearing them several times a week since! 

The chamois is soooooooooooo comfortable. Seriously--it fits perfect. The wide waistband stays in place and doesn't dig in. It's fitted in all the right places without being too tight, and super cushy for hours in the saddle. I am usually dying to get out of my shorts after a ride, but I've had no problem keeping these on for dinner and the car ride home. The chamois is so good, I really wish Patagonia would consider selling it separately. 

I'd give the shorts themselves 4 stars--they are almost a 5, but I think Patagonia could make a few changes to get that extra star. The material is perfect--super cool, comfortable, quick drying. I really have washed them a million times and they still look great. 
BUT: the look is a bit frumpy--I think they could be just a little more fitted on the leg--not tight--they just need some more shape to them. 
And hey Patagonia--WHY DO THE GUYS GET A ZIPPER POCKET?! (That's me yelling for equality ;) The front pockets are extra deep and fit my phone, but when I'm flying down the mountain I want to make sure it stays secure--give us a zipper too!

"Patagonia","Dirt Craft Bike Shorts - Women's","106312630",5,"Reader's Digest Version: You'd think that a company like Patagonia, with climbing-specific roots, would struggle with the fit and design of a bike short. But they most certainly do not (struggle, that is)! The Dirt Craft touts a full-coverage, comfortable fit that you can depend on right off the bat.

Non-Reader's Digest Version: I've had a love-hate relationship with bike clothing for the longest time, especially with liners. Usually the chamois never fits me - at all. And I get it, I don't have the kind of body type that's in-line with most bike-specific fits. But, to say the least, it's been a very uncomfortable experience in the long run. Bibs are fine-ish. So to say the least I was super skeptical when I bought these.

At any rate, I sort of expected that the Dirt Craft would be a miss and that I'd be returning these... And I was so wrong! So, yes, the Dirt Craft does have a high rise, but I personally like that. Also, I have a short waist so everything is high rise on me. However, the manner in which the Dirt Craft is high rise doesn't lead to uncomfortable pinching or weird bulging. There's something about the liner's waist band that discourages that ""lower-ab-pressure"" which in turn promotes a really great fit and feel. I bought an XS and the liner fits comparable to an XS in the Capilene line. 

1. Okay so, as Sverre noted, the chamois is SO INSANELY COMFORTABLE. Yes, that statement is deserving of all caps. It seems to have better contouring and coverage than other chamois I've used. 
2. Liner fabric. It's soft, quick-drying and unreal how comfy it is. Also, the mesh inserts are supreme and provide subtle, yet substantial ventilation. 
3. The 3-in-1 versatility. This design feature really appeals to me. I love the fact that I can wear the Dirt Craft together or separately. That being said, I wouldn't wear the liner on its lonesome - simply because of the showy mesh inserts.
4. The shorts. I can move and groove and do pretty much everything and anything in them. Patagonia has been creating movement-centric clothing for a long time, so I'd like to think they know a thing or two about designing shorts that are built for mobility.

My only wish is that the waist (on the shorts) had one of Patagonia's Oppo-Set adjuster, or like, had a built-in belt. Other than that, I love love love love the Dirt Craft.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-24 00:00:00","",""

"Patagonia","Dirt Craft Bike Shorts - Women's","5609788",5,"I just need to get this off my chest, I feel like a total d-bag for ordering $150 Patagonia cycling shorts. I fully expected to try them on and return them immediately, but these shorts are magical. So here's the great stuff:
1) No. Muffin. Top. Hallelujah! I'd converted my cycling wardrobe entirely to bib shorts because I hadn't been able to find a chamois that doesn't make my belly bulge. Major breakthrough :-)
2) Extraordinarily comfy chamois. Of course everyone will experience this differently. Out of the box I used these shorts on a strenuous 2-day bike tour. I have never been so comfortable on my bike. I typically wear Castelli bibs that I thought were really comfy, but this Patagonia chamois blew them out of the water. The Patagonia chamois has deep contouring that fits my anatomy well. This seems to eliminate any extra chamois fabric that can bunch up on a long ride and irritate my hoo-ha. 
3) Overshorts have a solid waistband. Often I find baggies are too stretchy and work their way down my butt as I'm riding. Really frustrating when you're on and off your seat, catching the crotch of the shorts on your saddle. These shorts stay put, and even have belt loops if you're so inclined.

The things Patagonia can do better on the next iterations:
1) These shorts look more frumpy than other mtb overshorts (like Yeti, Pearl Izumi, Shredly).  They're baggy, straight cut shorts with no shape whatsoever. They actually fit very similarly to the Patagonia Baggies (although the sizing is different). Patagonia could work on the styling of the shorts just a bit.
2) Talk about boring colors. I'm glad they're not going all periwinkle on us, but these shorts would be awesome in a bright Hawaiian print.  

My sizing: I have a 28"" natural waist and 37"" hips, the Small fit well. FYI, I have a long torso so shorts that are supposed to hit women at their natural waist normally grab me right in my lovehandles. Didn't make a difference with these shorts.

"Patagonia","Away From Home Pant - Women's","2012747253",5,"I recently completed a 12 day road trip KY to MT that took me into the back country of Grand Teton NP, Yellowstone NP and the Gallatin River Valley of MT.  I utilized these pants for short day hikes (6-8 miles) as well as long day hikes (24+ miles).

First, let me address the fit.  The pant is narrow through the waist and hips but for women like myself (5'6""/145 lbs) who need narrow fitting pants due to narrow hips, these were a god send.  Most hiking pants are too large in the waist and hips creating gaps that prevent them from being comfortable while on long hikes that require you to carry a pack.

Second, the narrow fit down through the legs was also a god send.  These pants are bootcut which again, allows for room to breathe but not too much fabric to encourage rubbing/chaffing.

Lastly, the durability of these pants was awesome.  As I was packing light, I only brought along a total of 3 pairs of pants for the entire trip (2 of these and 1 Khul) and these stood up to the test.  They proved to be stain resistant, comfortable after multiple wears and stylish enough that I was able to wear them out to the bar after completing my hikes and not feel bad about it.

Typically, I like to give a balanced review with both pros and cons but unfortunately there are no cons to be found with these pants.  I recommend that you get a pair while they are available and get out into nature and put them to the test!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-11-02 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Patagonia","Capilene Thermal Weight Bottom - Women's","4057022",5,"SIZE AND FIT: I'm 5' 4.75"" and around 100 lbs. for the current season, have a petite frame, and tend to carry my weight in my bottom half as opposed to my torso, chest (33AA), and arms. (See my profile for full sizing info.) I chose to go with the XS in the thermal weight bottoms. I currently have the Patagonia Merino Midweight bottoms in XXS, and those fit me quite a bit better as a baselayer, but these thermal weight bottoms fit me pretty well, though are a little loose (i.e., not skin-tight). Base layers should be a truly slim fit so they can really perform their primary job--keeping you dry and warm--and I think these do fit true to size in Patagonia's slim fit. For me, since I'm about average height, they do run a little long. If your primary use for baselayers is skiing, I would recommend Patagonia's boot-length thermal weight bottoms and then pair them with their ski socks.

PERFORMANCE: These things are super comfortable and breathable. In colder pursuits, these are perfect for wearing under ski pants, but would be a little bulky if you were trying to fit them underneath an everyday pant for walking around town, for instance. In that case, I would definitely go for the midweight baselayer as opposed to the thermal weights, but both have their place in the closet (or backpack!). The next-to-skin comfort on these is really great, and I prefer them over all baselayers in that arena. For me, I really think that merino edges out capilene in terms of odor control, but that is a very minor concern with these. The breathability and the built-in odor protection do a great job. In fact, I get away with wearing these day in and day out, and only wash them probably every five times I wear them for moderate-activity pursuits (though Iâm waiting for colder temps to get a better idea and will update with any news). Finally, these move really well and are not constricting in the least; going along with that, they also move very well amongst other layers--I never feel any pull or tug against the midlayer, and that's important when youâre moving around a lot.

BOTTOM LINE: In terms of comfort and breathability, these make it to the top of my list for baselayers. (The color is great, too!) And because they're polyester, I'm really looking forward to their longevity. The 1/4-zip thermal weight capilene tops are some of my favorite pieces of the fall '15 line as well. These will be a great addition for walking the dog in cold temps, skiing, hiking in cold conditions, or even standing outside waiting for the bus.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-12-20 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Patagonia","Black Hole 120L Wheeled Duffel","3015839",2,"I had recently purchased this bag prior to a three month trip. At the end of the trip the wheels were damaged and bent in. This happened with only 45lbs or gear. It is a nice bag, but only for airport travel. This bag lacks the strength and durability to be a large duffel. 

Since writing this post I opted to go with the REI 34 inch rolling duffel. Im not a huge fan of REI, but their bag seems much more durable and better constructed than the Patagonia bag. The Tatonka Flight Roller looks like a quality bag as well and is quite large at 135 L.

The bag is great, but having a wheeled duffle I expect it to be really tough. The new material that patagonia is using on their black hole line of duffles is not as durable. This is fine for the rest of the duffles, but the wheeled one needs to be a little more durable to take all the abuse of being dragged around corners and getting pulled up and around stair wells. In my opinion the north face wheeled duffle is far more durable with its thicker fabric. Yes, the NF bag is a little heavier, but for the purpose that trade off is worth it.

I’m going on a year long trip and this will undoubtedly serve the purpose of packing for a year and 4 seasons. 

Also because of it’s durable outside you don’t have to worry about the seams or fabric/material ripping. The outer material is water resistant which is perfect because in previous bags it’s been a pain to try and maintain clean contents and interior when the exterior becomes wet and dirty. The material can be wiped off and looks great and the contents in the bag will have remained dry. 

Additionally, the clam shell flap design allows access to all sides of the interior space, unlike many duffels that simply zip down the middle. The extendable handle works smoothly and glides easily up and down. The wheels are very nice and I am not worried about them breaking or getting stuck if rolled over uneven material. Inside there are straps that cover and strap down all of the things inside to make everything tight and compact. 

In addition to the well made and durable bag, it’s very appealing to the eye. I got mine in Underwater Blue which I absolutely love.

"Patagonia","Toromiro 22L Backpack","2873523",5,"I bought this on a whim from SAC - it was cheap and orange and Patagonia makes quality bags. I thought I would use it for a week and be over it and probably give it away.

This thing ROCKS. I normally hate bucket opening bags for 22L, this thing can hold a ton! I'm talking a weekend trip ton. Most 22L bags I own (I have a few...) are messenger style or suitcase style and don't leave room for the odd shaped items. Once you put a laptop in one of those bags, it's all over. NOT WITH THE TOROMIRO! Seriously, I'm excited because everything is awesome.

First of all, it fits great. I am 5'2"" with an athletic build and it's super comfy. My fiance wears it when we hike and he's 5'10"", also athletic. Why would I take this hiking? Simple... this bag is great for work and play! First choice for hiking? Not so much, but when I only have room to pack one bag for work and play, this is the one I use. 

Style - I thought I would despise the bucket opening and top lid zipper. I thought I would lose things in the large main compartment and things would just fall out of the top zipper opening. NOPE. Nothing sloshes around awkwardly either. Things stay put in the top zipper and even when I accidentally leave open I don't lose things! 

I think the biggest win for me was using this on a recent 6 week business trip to Costa Rica. I knew I wanted to explore on the weekends, but I also needed a daily to and from work bag. It was rainy season in Costa Rica, and this bag got DOWNPOURED on daily. With my work laptop in tow, I was concerned initially but after a few treks back to my hotel and hoping for the best, the bag was soaked by contents DRY. 

I don't recommend submerging this, as it's not waterproof... but to and from in the rain, the resistance definitely holds up. 

Not only was this a big win for me, but being able to empty work contents and pack it for the weekend (Friday-Sunday) was amazing! I shoved my hiking gear, extra food, water, pj's and toiletries in the 22L and off I went! I clipped extra shoes on the outside as well as some other gear.  

Don't get me wrong, this was stuffed full, but I always had full access to the zippered parts. Usually, when I fill a bag, it restricts all the other compartments and I hate it. 

I took this bag on volcano hikes, beach trips (with really dirty volcanic sand), resort trips, and many bus trips. This thing is filthy, but you can't tell. It still looks pretty new... which is shocking. 

I thought the sand would never come out.... I held it upside down and gave it a shake and you can't even tell it went to a beach. 

The ONLY thing that shows wear and tear on my bag is the straps, and only because one time I wore a blue shirt hiking and it rained. Combining sweat and rain and straps - they show a little faint blue color from the dye. 

No complaints. Ordering another one in another color just for fun. Check SAC!

I got this pack a few weeks ago, it caught my eye as I was looking for a less technical pack. Most of my other backpacks are very brightly colored and feature-filled. I needed something a little more low-key, for commuting and overnight getaways. This pack fit the bill perfectly! 

The big zippered opening makes packing so easy, everything is able to nest well and the weight balances. The small zipered pocket on the top of the pack is sturdy enough for when you have 2 sets of keys, and all of the cassettes that were in your 1998 Subaru up top. Maybe that's just me... Anyway, it rules.

The laptop sleeve in the back is top notch. The sturdy buckle at the top ensures your lappy doesn't zoom out of the bag when your dog decides to leap from the car into the yard, carrying the pack with her. 

The shoulder straps are nothing special, and are adjustable enough for very tall to very average-heighted humans (and dogs). ","EMPLOYEE","2016-03-17 00:00:00","I've used it several times","true"

I love this jacket. I've worn it a couple of times now and it almost seems to adjust its warmth to how warm it is as long as I'm outside. Super lightweight. It will be perfect for backpacking (which is what I purchased it for), but I think I'll also be living in this thing.

"Patagonia","Ultralight Down Hooded Jacket - Women's","106312630",5,"I picked up this jacket about a week ago, and have been wearing it for just about every endeavor since then (with the exception of a warm bluebird hike with the dogs). I was looking for a lightweight down alternative to my go-to Nano Air, which still holds the reigning crown for The Best Jacket Ever, but it now has a hard and fast contender for which one I grab.

I stepped outside of my box as far as the fit is concerned, and picked up a Medium rather than my go-to Small or Extra-Small. And while the medium certainly is baggy, it fits akin to a mid-thigh parka. The sleeves are a little long and the shoulders are a bit loose, but I'm far from phased as the fit doesn't impede my mobility. Though, regardless of my happiness with its size, I would recommend to anyone else that you pick up your go-to size in this jacket. 

This jacket lives up to its name and is indeed ultralight - I would venture to say it's barely noticeable when I've worn it layered beneath a hard shell or on its own. The hood is fairly generous, so I'm grateful for the adjustable drawcord. The hand pockets are not lined, nor do they have down insulation backing them so don't expect them to offer warm respire for cold paws. The chest pocket easily accommodates an iPhone 6. And while this certainly wasn't something I take issue with, the Feather Grey colorway is really quite dapper, and despite the incredibly thin and lightweight constitution of the Pertex exterior, no down feathers are physically visible through the material - which I know some folks aren't a fan of. 

I run pretty darn cold, so I decided the best way for me to test this jacket's warmth-to-weight ratio was while skiing in freaking-bitter-cold temperatures this weekend. Utah was bestowed with a glorious amount of powder, so I knew I'd be working hard at random points during the day which, again, I figured would test the jacket's adaptability and breathability. I layered the Ultralight with a Nano Air vest (which is debatable as to whether or not that was necessary - jury's still out on it), Merino Air hoodie, and the Untracked hard shell jacket. There were definitely moments in which I was too hot, which I chalked up to the unnecessary donning of the Nano Air vest. But all in all, I was super comfortable, cozy, and regulated my temperature with ease. Plus, the extra length came in handy when I was sitting on cold chairlifts.

Bottom Line: this jacket performed stupendously. It kept me cozy, regulated my temperature, and breathed really quite well. Admittedly, I wasn't expecting the Ultralight to perform as well or even close to the performance of the Nano Air, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it did. Though, I still prefer the innate adaptability of the Nano Air as it's crafted with synthetic insulation and the down of the Ultralight doesn't fair well in wet weather (though, it does just fine when layered beneath a waterproof hard shell). I'm interested to see how this jacket fairs in the long run.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-27 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

Height: 5' 4.75""

Weight: 105 lb.
Dress/Pant Size: 0/25 
Bra: 32A/34AA/XS/S 

I have this in an XS.

FIT: As this is part of Patagonia's alpine collection, this jacket will run a bit long so it can fit under a harness comfortably. Since I have pretty narrow hips, I have no issues there, though if it were made in an XXS I would definitely choose that since I wear this generally over a single baselayer and maybe a light fleece insulator, like an R1 or thermal-weight Capilene. However, the fit is comfortable for me.

PERFORMANCE: I recently wore this on a several day trip to romp around some of my favorite parks, and the weather was chilly, damp, and generally dreary. It was a perfect companion all trip long--on a cold train, in the parks, hanging outside with my dog at night, etc. I run cold, and this performed very well all the way down to about 45 degrees F. Below that, I have to throw on an extra layer underneath (no big deal), or I would go up to the next jacket (e.g., Patagonia's Down Sweater Hoody). The thing I most appreciate about this jacket (besides traceable down) is how lightweight it is for how warm it is. I plan on this being my go-to jacket for many more trips (let alone errands around town, to and from climbing on chilly days, etc.). My one beef is always the single drawcord for the hem, but this is more of an aesthetic peeve.

BOTTOM LINE: I hesitated about a year to get this jacket, and as soon as I put it on, I didn't want to take it off--I wore it as much as possible for a couple weeks straight (except for an anomalous 80-degree day) because I absolutely love its comfortable level of warmth. Like the Nano Air, I have been tending to keep this on and leave it on, and I cannot wait to see how it performs on bigger objectives.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-10-22 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

After more than 50 days and nights in the backcountry, I washed the jacket and it looks like new again. So I can wear it to work, too!

A few notes: this isn't intended to be a ski-weight winter jacket. It's an ultralight layer for those needing both weight savings and warmth in a three-season layer. I wore this as part of a layering system, with a mid-weight wool base and a rain/wind jacket to keep drafts out. I stayed comfortable most of the time and only moderately chilly (not dangerously cold) when temps dipped into the 20s. I had a down quilt I could have wrapped up in if it got any colder than that. Speaking of the quilt, this jacket was also part of my sleep system on cold nights, providing the hood that a quilt is missing. 

The word ""system"" is key for ultralight hikers. Everything needs to work together.  No single component needs to (or should!) work entirely on its own.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-09-21 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

I have this in black, and it has a nice little sheen to it that I think makes it more fun. Added bonus, I've received more compliments on this jacket than anything else I own!

This number has been with me three years now and it looks just as good today as it did the day bought it - and it has traveled with me errywhere. Seriously awesome.

"Patagonia","Downtown Down Jacket - Women's","1219248",5,"I bought this jacket for my fiancee but would like to share her impressions along with some of my own opinions.  She already has a Patagonia Down Sweater (size XS) and is a big fan.  It is one of her most used pieces in the fall, winter, and spring (we live in NY/CT, so there is a long season for puffy jackets).  I suggested that she get a warmer puffy with a hood to use as an alternative to her winter parka.  She first tried the Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoody (size S) but found the cut unflattering, slightly too big, and probably not as warm as desired.

Fast forward a few weeks, and we decided to do a side by side comparison of the Downtown Loft Down Jacket and the Hi-Loft Hooded Down Sweater.  Here is my analysis of the key differences:

Downtown vs Hi-loft:
Runs small vs normal  (S vs XS were about the same size)
Form fitting vs more boxy
More subtle branding vs standard Patagonia logo
Heavier vs lighter (due to beefier outer shell material, it seems)

That analysis is not meant to say that one jacket is better than the other but merely that they probably have different target users.  The Downtown Jacket, as the name would suggest, is a better fit for folks who want a more stylish jacket for staying warm around town that will also work really well for staying warm on outdoor activities.  I could very much see this jacket used as a ski jacket on dry days (or under a shell with wet snow).  The Hi-Loft also seems like a great jacket but is more in line with Patagonia's traditional offering (and boxier cut).  

The hood stows away into the shawl collar.  After a first impression, this seems to be one of the best designed features of the jacket: the hood is large enough and seems to be quite warm, but when stowed away it helps turn the collar into a sturdy and warm shawl collar, which looks like it will really help keep in warmth and beat away wind without having to have the hood fully deployed.

Stay tuned for further impressions on this jacket.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-10-07 00:00:00","I gave it as a gift but have feedback to share",""

     - Outdoor playtime with my dogs and hikes

The coat has a feminine cut, which was different from my old coat, so it felt a little snug on the first wear, but it was really just a matter of me getting used to the cut.  

Now, keep in mind I've only owned this coat for a little over a week, but so far this has been a win across the board!  I purchased this in black (goes with everything) and am able to wear mid-weight layers with ease -- dress shirts, blazers (albeit these make the coat a little more snug), thermals.  I've received several compliments at the office and feel that it looks even better in person and is professional looking (in case I bump into some executives -- doesn't look disheveled and bulky like my old down coat was getting).

"Patagonia","Heywood Flannel Shirt - Women's","106312630",5,"Reader's Digest Version: If you love the Fjord, you'll probably love the Heywood. Buuut, if you love soft and light flannel on the whole, you'll probably love the Heywood, too.

Non-Reader's Digest Version: Flannels are great, they're one of those things that you can't go wrong with. And the Heywood? You especially can't go wrong with. I love the Fjord, but have found that its thick and plush fabric isn't as comfy during cool summer evenings as I'd like it to be. Enter: The Heywood. 

The fabric is soft and thin, yet not paper thin. It's the perfect summer-weight flannel material - great for chilly mornings or evenings, or brisk, a/c laden offices. I love the pockets, they further differentiate the Heywood from the Fjord which is cool. 

As for the fit, the Heywood is a little more slim in the shoulders than the Fjord. However, the fit in the torso / waist is comparable to the Fjord. The cuffs (on the sleeves) are a little more slim-fitting, too, which is a nice touch as the giant cuffs on the Fjord was a pet peeve of mine. I can wear a 0 or 2 in Patagonia's button-up shirts, but often prefer the fit of the 2, so I went with the 2 per usual. I wear an XS in the rest of Patagonia's line, or Small if I want a little extra room. 

Bottom Line: this flannel is perfect for summer, fall, spring, and winter. It's not as paper thin as I was expecting, which I much prefer. It's a really nice alternative to the Fjord, so if you run hot or you prefer thinner flannels, the Heywood is your gal. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-07-07 00:00:00","",""

Don't size down if you want to roll up your sleeves! I do prefer thicker, hardier flannels, but the trend these days for ladies flannel is to run lightweight, unfortunately.

Once the water starts to seep through you're gonna hate wearing this jacket, since it's pretty much like wearing a wet, oily sack that sticks to your skin, stifles your respiration, and lets water drip through the zipper.

"Patagonia","Venga Rock Pant - Women's","106312630",4,"Reader's Digest Version: This pant is super comfortable. I'd venture to say that the Venga is most ideal for gym or mild-weather climbing at, say, the Gunks or Boulder Canyon. I do occasionally wear the Venga to work as the color I own is less prone to showcasing The Accumulated Gnar and the stretchy material is definitely nice for all-day wearability.

Non-Reader's Digest Version: I really like the fact that the Venga is not made with a swishy, static-y material. The material is just super comfortable. That being said, the cotton component does lend itself to stretching out (a lot) and isn't great for climbing in damp, humid, or super hot conditions (simply because it won't dry quickly). However, the hint of spandex is awesome because it provides ample mobility and the gusseted crotch bolsters my range of motion (which, all pants should have a gusseted crotch IMHO - just saying). I love, love, love the OppoSet adjustment - I get a personalized fit in the waist without having to wear a belt (which is an awesome detail when you're wearing a harness). There are belt loops, but meh, I never use them. The length is also pretty primo, I don't have to up-cuff the pant to prevent them from dragging on the ground. As for the fit, I wear a XS (or SM for a relaxed fit) / 24 (in Gap, J.Crew, Patagonia) in bottoms and the 0 initially fits great, but it does stretch out a bit in the waist hence my love for the OppoSet adjustable doo-hickey.

My only qualms are as such: I do wish that the rise on this pant was a little higher, simply for the sake of coverage. Also, it would be awesome if these pants had an internal drawcord at the hems - though, I have remedied my displeasure with this lack-of-feature by tight-rolling my pants at the cuff. If you've never tight-rolled your cuffs, look it up - it will come in handy  more often than you think it will!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-03 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Patagonia","Venga Rock Pant - Women's","106553899",3,"Patagonia strikes back with another beyond-bizarre sizing... Woohoo.

For starters, I'm 5'9"", 135-140lbs (pizza-dependent), with bigger skier quads, slightly wider hips, medium butt. Generally, I have a 28in waist and 35in hips, and wear a 4/6 in most climbing/hiking pants.

The 6 was loose in the waist, fitted in the rear and hips, semi-fitted in the thighs... But after an afternoon of climbing around, they stretched out to the point of nearly falling off my bum. Upon trying on the size 4, they were snug in the waist and TIGHT in the rear/hips/thighs, but stretched out to a reaaaally comfortable fit after a bit of climbing. They're a teeny bit short, but not too bad. If you're generally between sizes in pants, definitely go with the smaller size in these.

I snagged the bright blue color, and hoooooly guacamole it's vibrant. Perhaps a lil' loud for me, but awesome. It does show dirt and sweat (ew), and the fabric could be a bit more durable for climbing. My main pet peeve (besides the weird stretching/cut) is that the leg openings DON'T HAVE ANY CINCHING. Woof. It's beyond annoying to not be able to see your feet and have to shake the cuff around to ensure you're really toeing into small features. I usually roll them up due to this, but if these pants had little cinches at the bottom like the Prana Avril pants, I'd be aaaaalll over them.

Bottom line:

These are the pants you want for a long session bouldering or ARCing in the gym, or sport climbing in BCC. 

These are NOT the pants you want to wear while scumming on sandstone and writhing through offwidths in the desert. They will end up with some new ""ventilation holes"" and interesting red-dirt type stains.","EMPLOYEE","2017-01-31 00:00:00","I've used it several times","true"

1. Both have holes and tear at the slightest abrasion of rock. I've had climbing pants (even yoga pants) withstand greater force. 
2. Climbing is a dirty sport - between the dusty crag and rope scum, clothing gets dirty. I have no idea why, but this fabric hold onto dirt and grime even after being washed. Especially the purple ones. To quote one of my climbing friends: 'you look like a coal miner' - and this was after washing them! I can only wear these in a dirt-bag friendly environment (i.e. the crag) and not out in public, because I look too damn dirty and greasy.

Fit/sizing:
They do run small as I am 5'1, 120 lbs and I got the men's size small and they fit pretty well, a tiny bit long but since they're a jogger style the elastic at the bottom keeps them from dragging.  My boyfriend is 5'11 , 150 lbs with skinny legs and the medium fits perfectly.  

Pros: 
Stylish 
Quick dry 
Durable
Keeps you cool 

Cons:
Loud (think George Costanza swooshy suit) 
They don't make them in more sweet colors like the camo/hickory print 
Things fall out of the front pockets super easy

The fabric seems nice and durable, no signs of wear or abrasion after a pretty busy month. I found the gear loops and straps to be convenient and well thought out. (I particularly like the small elastic/metal pieces to lock down ice-axe & ice tools).

The pack is probably a little bit small for multi-day trips (though you can manage if you strap enough camping gear on the outside for the approach). Also, the lack of external water bottle pockets and very simple design are perfect for climbing, but probably not the most convenient for general hiking and backpacking (though I used this bag on plenty of day hikes, and it worked quite well).

I have used it extensively for the last several months, for those that have had durability concerns from the last generation. This includes multi day ski tours, overnight alpine trips, and technical ski mountaineering where the skis are on the pack a good share of the time.

Fully packed, the carry system was very comfortable, evenly distributing the weight and keeping things close to the body. I found that the waist belt would loosen a bit while touring, probably due to having a smaller waist and being pretty maxed out on the adjustment. I have a good friend who also uses this bag that hasn't experienced the same issue, so it may just come down to body type.

I missed the extra capacity of the previous model as well as the spindrift collar, which allowed for some over-stuffing on bigger trips out. That said, with the dual daisy chains running the length of the pack there are tons of options for strapping down gear and tailoring it to your needs.

All in all, a solid choice for a go-to alpine pack. The 40L capacity is dead on for a short multi-day tour or a bigger alpine objective. The pack never feels bulky and held up well to crampon points and ski edges. If you're trying to keep things fast and light you'd be hard-pressed to find a better bag for the job.

"Patagonia","Capilene Thermal Weight Zip-Neck Hooded Top - Women's","2114556227",5,"The Patagonia Capilene thermal weight zip neck hoody is my go to backcountry (and resort) ski layer.  I'll literally pull it our of the dirty laundry and wear it anyways... even when I shouldn't. ""Why?"", you may ask. This base layer is the perfect amount of warm and breathable. I find it is generally warm enough to wear on its own when the tour gets steep or sunny, but not so much that it makes you sweat profusely or want to take it off. Also, I'm a no-hat kind of ski-tourer, so I love that you can effortlessly pop the hood up mid-tour if it gets shady or windy and your find your ears to be frozen. 

But wait, how does it fit? 
This baselayer is listed as slim-fitting (as I tend to want my baselayers). It has a nice form-hugging feel so you can add a plethora of extra layers, but it is not uncomfortably tight. The thumb loops are great to slip on when you want to add your puffy and don't want your baselayer sleeves to roll up with it. I don't wear the thumb loops while touring, usually because I pull the sleeves up around my forearms for air anyways, but they are cozy enough that you could. 

I am a little over 5'9'' and about 140 lbs. I am fairly athletically built with broad shoulders and muscular arms. I usually wear a Patagonia medium or size 6, and the medium fits me perfectly. I have a fairly long torso and the hem hits me right about at the hips. It is long enough to tuck in, but not long enough to be bulky. The sleeves are the perfect length for my wingspan, and the hood fits over my head perfectly. 

I think my favorite feature of this top is the zipper/hoody combo. The zipper is great because when it is really warm, you can unzip and get good airflow. However, when its really cold, you can zip it up to your chin and pop a hat or helmet. Suddenly, the icy wind or cold snow isn't blowing down your neck anymore. Keeping your head and neck cool or warm (respectively), is one of the best ways to thermoregulate and prevent excessive heat gain/loss. 

The only downside of this piece is that I find it has what I call.... the ""perma-pew."" Since I do use this layer for sweat inducing ski tours or ice climbs, it usually gets really stinky. After just one use post-wash, it is back to smelling like I've been living in the woods without a bath for months. It definitely doesn't have any sort of odor guard, but hey, you're going to be outside anyways right? 

Hope this review was helpful. I very much recommend this top over other capilene or base layers by other companies for cold weather activities such as ski touring or ice climbing. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-03-23 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Patagonia","Capilene Thermal Weight Zip-Neck Hooded Top - Women's","4057022",5,"Sending an enormous thank you to Patagonia and Backcountry.com for selecting me to review this piece. I'm really happy to be a part of the awesome community that is Backcountry.com! Thanks for making me feel 'at home'!

My current measurements:
Height: 5' 4.75""
Weight: 105 lbs./47.6 kg
Pant size: 0/25 - Waist: 26 in.
Bra size: 34AA
Neck: 12.5 in.
Biceps: average 8.5 in.

DISCLAIMER: I have yet to test this piece as a true baselayer/layering piece, so my review is incomplete! However, I do have some things to say about the fit, so that if you do choose to get it, you'll at least know what size to go with.

FIT--BODY: The fit is listed as Patagonia's slim fit. Indeed, this size is true to their slim fit--which for my measurements, still has a little bit of wiggle room. Though Patagonia does make this in an XXS, which probably would fit me from just under my band measurement and down, I have slightly broad shoulders and 1+ in. ape index, so I needed all the length out of the arms I could get. The loops for the thumbs are slightly constricting for me at first because of this, but because of sensory adaptation, I don't feel them after a couple minutes, and go about my business just fine. I can see that when I go skiing these will really come in... handy (yeah, pun intended). The length of this piece is just right--hits about an inch below where my belt is on low-ish-rise jeans. It will be great for tucking into pants while skiing--it'll stay put since it doesn't run short, and I have a pretty long torso compared to my legs. Finally, the chest isn't restricting at all for me since I have a small chest. And because I have room there, I reckon--all other measurements being accurate--an XS may be good for even a smaller B-cup, perhaps. But of course, try it on if you can.

FIT--HOOD: The hood fits really nicely over my head, without constricting any part of my neck--it moves well even if you turn your head downward and side to side. Of course, you may look like a little alien (I have it in that awesome green) but I like it and it's super functional--YOU CAN PUT YOUR PONY TAIL THROUGH THE BACK!!!!

FIT--NECK: I'm really finicky about zippers near my windpipe--so whenever a zipper even slightly touches me there, I really notice it, but maybe it's just me. In fact, I think the placement of the zipper and its ability to NOT constrict the neck are some of the nice features about this baselayer; the neck is not--I repeat--not tight, and somehow the patterning of this piece manages to fit over the chin perfectly without being tight or awkward (which for me, will be nice while running in cold weather). It kind of comes up toward the center when fully zipped, leading to coverage even toward your lower lip. It's going to be great for cold temps in various settings. 

PERFORMANCE: Like I said, I haven't tried this out as a baselayer. It hasn't been cold enough to give it a try as such, but I've worn it as my top layer in about 55ÂºF + weather, and it seems really breathable even at those temps, and hasn't gotten stinky in between wears. I'm a moderate sweater.

BOTTOM LINE: Though updates and pics are indeed to come, I can recommend that this piece should perform fantastically in cold temperatures as a baselayer. (Though I've really been loving it even as a go-to ""pull over"" for the time being!) Be sure to take some measurements and get the right size--you don't want it too loose, as it is a baselayer.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-09-01 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Patagonia","R1 Fleece Hooded Pullover - Women's","106553899",4,"The R1 is my go-to layer for highly aerobic outdoor activities in cold temps, whether it's charging up a skin track or climbing a couple of blustery pitches after work. Oh, and really aggressive lounging/snacking activities apres-ski. The soft, waffly material will keep you cozy and comfy warm, but can dump excess heat when you start moving.

The 3/4 zip feature is fabulous if you'll be layering and de-layering while wearing a helmet or hat-- I can easily take it on or off while wearing my POC Receptor Helmet or BD Vector Helmet when climbing or skiing. It serves the additional purpose of allowing you to thoroughly ventilate your torso if you start overheating. Some people have qualms about the extra long zipper, but if you're using it for the purpose of high-output alpine activities, I believe the design reflects user needs and offers great benefits for keeping cool and quick layer transitions.

However, as a fairly tall and gangly armed person (read my reviews and you'll notice this is a common theme), there is one MAJOR CON: the damn arms on this pullover are WAY short in comparison to the length and width of the body. Especially if I'm wearing a this with gloves or spending time at cold belays, thumb holes are a must have for me. If I wear the thumb holes on this for longer than 5 or 10 minutes, the loop starts digging in between my thumb and index finger to the point of being unbearable (yes, I know how melodramatic this sounds, and I don't care). The torso on the size medium is already a bit loose, and if I size up to a large, the sleeves fit better (not perfectly) but I'm swimming in the body. For reference, I am 5'9"", have a 5'10""ish wingspan, and weigh between 130-140lbs.

The fit is distinctly baggier than in years past. I don't think my body type is THAT abnormal, but it seems like this piece would only get a five star rating from me if I could sew size large arms on to a size small or medium hoody.

First, the obvious reasons of Patagonia quality,  construction and company values. Love them all.

Second, the benefits of having three items in one: a pullover fleece, a neck gaiter and a hat. The 'scuba' looking hood acts as (at least in non-sub 10 temps) as a neck gaiter and a hat saving me from having to bring multiple items on a hike. When it is super chilly, I'll put a fleece beenie on under the hood and also pull up the hood on my outer shell to stay toasty warm.  

Third, easy temperature regulation as temperatures rise/fall throughout the day by just popping the hood down vs. pulling a neck gaiter or hat on/off and having to stash away in your pack. I also have a strange claustrophobia thing about neck-gaiters (it can feel mildly choking or suffocating to have one on) so not having to wear one above 10-20 degree weather is awesome. The low-cut front zipper also really helps to cool you down fast if you need to.

I wear it hiking, wash it after each wear and it's held up great. I don't dry it due to its form-fitting shape (and trying to save energy).

I usually buy an XS in the R1 series but opted for the Small as I found that they run a little more snug than the other R1 options do. 
So - it wicks well, dries well, washes well keeps me warm well and gets stinky just the way I like it. I suggest the R1 to anyone who will listen to me.

My hubs was stoked to get this jacket for his birthday this year and even more stoked to get to wear it for the first time. Living in Portland, OR, we get a lot of rain and with that rain comes a need for ultra rainproof gear. This jacket was possibly a rare exception, possibly a defective item that made it out of the Patagonia factory, because it wet down within the very first hour of wearing it in the rain.  After walking around in fairly, mild rain with the hood up, my husband asked me if the back of his neck was wet or just cold. Imagine my stunned disbelief when I found that the panel at the base of the hood was completely wet down and his shirt beneath it had begun to absorb rainwater.  Fortunately, as proper Portlanders, we always keep spare jackets in the car, but we were really disappointed in this piece's performance.

"Patagonia","Levitation Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","105713282",5,"The Levitation Hoody was gifted to me at Christmas by my girlfriendââand what a good gift it was. She knows of my Patagonia fixation, the brand I really trust when going outside, and thus fueled it further.

Full disclosure: I also own a Patagonia Dimensions Jacketââmy go to softshell for skiing and climbing when the weather is really inclement. 

The Levitation Hoody, by contrast, is a water and wind resistant hoody that won't protect you quite as well as a heavier softshell, but is supremely breathable, comfortable, and, most importantlyââLIGHT. 

Pros: 

Extremely lightweightââyou forget you are wearing it, or carrying it in your pack. I really look forward to using this in a Colorado summer while hiking and backpacking 14ers.

 Articulated athletic fitââtrue to size in every way. Sleeves are just the right length, and the taper is perfect for slender, well muscled climbers and skiers. You can be confident ordering the right size for you.

Very comfortable for skiing on days where temps are 20+ degrees.

Repels rainââI had to take a flight to the midwest (yuck) a month ago and didn't have a dedicated rain jacketââthis hoody held up admirably and dried out quickly! 

Cons: 

Not really anything. The jacket could conceivably be more versatile in terms of handling cold and intense wind, but then it would sacrifice some of the qualities that it excels in. 

Conclusion: 

Great, inexpensive, good looking, good feeling shell to have in your quiver. Here's a picture of me backcountry skiing near Vail wearing the Hoody. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-02-14 00:00:00","",""

As a petite woman that also loves fishing, I know too well the struggle of trying to find gear that works and that isn't 2x the price of mens gear or in some nauseating shade of pink. These are pricey now as the newest model -  I paid $80 for last years version. But, I still think these are well worth a look by all the flyfishing women out there.

I've been looking for an upgrade from my disastrous old felts, but women's specific boots are insanely expensive. On the verge of breaking down and dropping close to $200 on the Simms wading boots, I discovered these and thought that maybe a size 5 would fit me - being between a 6-7 in a womens street shoe. These fit perfectly with a good pair of socks and my waders on! They're so light, give excellent ankle support, and will take studs. Some of the reviews say that they're not very sticky - to that, I say, anything on the planet is stickier than the ridiculous high heeled felts I started out with, and for $80, I can't wait to take them out on the river. 

For reference for women's sizing, I am 5""1 and 110lbs. I wear a 6-7 depending on shoe type and/or brand, and a 36-37 European size. I ordered these in the size 5 and they're perfect!

The Gore-Tex C-knit fabric feels much better against bare skin compared to the Gore-Tex Pro material, so this jacket can be worn with minimal baselayers in warm-but-windy situations. 

The breathability is exactly what you would expect from a Gore-Tex product! 

The fit runs a bit large; I typically wear a large, but sized down to a medium. The sleeves are still a little long, but everything else is great. 

The coat does have a small strap to attach it to Patagonia snow pants and bibs, however, it does lack a powder skirt for those deepest days! 

I expect that I'll buy another one of these when I finally do wear this coat out!



Season update: 

I have found the medium fit to run a little tight when wearing a beacon in addition to a puffy vest. 

The hood design is actually pretty poor- The single draw string pulls the hood back. You can see, but the sides of your face are exposed to wind and moisture. 

The coat exterior proves to be durable. Lots of tours and sidecountry on this one- no rubbing wear from pack shoulder straps or waist buckles. 

However, the c-knit material inside the coat seems to be less durable. There is obvious wear where the pack is pressed against my back by the backpack. It seems like the Goretex Pro material is more durable. 

The water resistance membrane seems to have held up. Shoulders and arms still bead water. The ares where the pack sits soak with water, but  it hasn't seeped through yet. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-11-07 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

It's definitely designed for an active skier/climber/hiker. It's lightweight so you need a good base and midlayer. I think it would work well skiing on any sunny day out west in February or March. It would work well on a warmish snowy day as well where you are sweating.

The one design flaw is the lack of a powder skirt, which is unfortunate. I hope next year they fix this, or add in more jackets with the C-knit construction.

The color scheme is nice too.

Size-wise: I like that it's not overly baggy. I tend to wear a Large in the Regulator Fleeces but usually have to downsize to a Medium in Patagonia shells. The same trend continues with this (Medium). I do like that it's not quite as baggy as the PowSlayer or Powderbowl.

Fortunately I tested it before the trip on a practice hike, because as it turned out it was nowhere close to being H2NO - quite the opposite.

"Patagonia","Stretch Rainshadow Jacket - Women's","109774654",5,"The ultralight Stetch Rainshadow is one of the lightest fully-featured rain shells I have ever used. Weighing a scant 9.2 oz, the very packable Stretch Rainshadow has pit zippers, dual hand pockets, a drawcord hem, adjustable Velcro wrist stays,  and a chest pocket that it packs into and can clip into a carabiner. All of its zippers are coated with a waterproof DWR coating. 

The stretchy fabric it is made of feels amazingly soft and it is super breathable. It does not have a hard shell feel to it at all and is very comfortable for casual wear or high output activity. If you are familiar with Patagonia products, imagine a little bit heavier, but way more wind and waterproof Houdini.  I would say it is similar to the Outdoor Research Helium II and Marmot Essence, but better.

Hoods are normally a big concern of mine in rain shells, but this helmet- compatible hood cinches down tight easily and stays in place.

The fit is a regular fit, with appropriate room for layers. Some say it runs big, but I think it is true to size and built to accommodate layering. If you want a more snug and flattering fit, size down.

It pairs wonderfully with the Patagonia R1 or any of stretchy synthetic insulated  jackets ( Nano Air, Nano Air Hybrid, Arc'teryx Atom LT, The North Face Ventrix). It would be great for anything from spring backcountry skiing to hiking or climbing your favorite fourteener.

I wore it all day long in the rain and snow in Yellowstone last weekend and stayed bone dry and comfortable. My only complaint is that it can get kind of soggy after heavy rain or being out in rain for long periods of time. Wearing it with another layer made it perfectly fine, but if you are only wearing a t-shirt under it, it might feel clammy on your skin. You will stay completely dry due to Patagonia's proprietary H2NO membrane, but it can get clammy. As long as you don't have expectations for this to be a 3L Gore-Tex Pro shell, you will love it.

Bottom line: This is one of my favorite rain shells I've ever worn. I'm going to wear it every chance I get.

Breathability: The breathability is so-so. When you are choosing a raincoat that is this light, you have to have realistic expectations of the performance. If you are hiking on a humid New England day, you absolutely will sweat inside the coat. But with that in mind, the coat does an excellent job of keeping out the elements. 

Durability: After using this for the second half of my AT-thru hike, and on countless day hikes in New England, it accompanied me on a 2800 mile bike packing trip from Canada to mexico. We saw our fair share of rain, and I was never wet under the Houdini. I even crashed while wearing it, and expected a huge tear when I got up, but aside from a mud stain it held up. The helmet compatible hood works for a bike helmet.

Fit: This coat is designed with climbing in mind and has a slim fit, the medium is definitely a close fit on me, and a large would have done just as well.

This raincoat is a must have for ultralight backcountry pursuits.

On its first and only outing you can feel the extra fabric compared to the regular Houdini. Means it doesnt breathe as well but, protects much better. Right now in the Wasatch, the upper elevations are around 60 degrees, makes the normal Houdini the perfect option should you need a light shell. I had it in the Teton's where it was more like 40 degrees at the summits and it wasnt enough, this is where the Alpine Fits in my quiver of shells. Below 40 degrees and the verdict is still out on how far I can push it in the cold .

The first thing to notice is the difference in fit. Where the normal Houdini is a tighter, trimmer fit, the Alpine Houdini has extra room for layering. I own the Large in the normal Houdini and sized down to the Medium in the Alpine Houdini. I wouldnt say it runs Large, it fits like my large Westcomb ski jacket. That still has too much fabric to alpine rock climb for me. With the medium Alpine Houdini I still can layer with my go-to cold weather choice, which is: Capilene 1, R1 Hoody, Nano-Air Hoody, and then the Alpine Houdini. 

You can really tell the difference in fabric compared to the normal Houdini. The Alpine Houdini is stiffer, thicker, and much less air-permeable. When trying to stuff it into its own pocket it was creating air pockets, never saw that in the normal Houdini.

"Patagonia","Rio Gallegos Zip-Front Wader - Men's","3897830",5,"At long last Patagonia added a zip front wader and I could not be more pleased. I am a long time Patagonia Rio Gallegos wader owner using my last pair over four years across the entire western US. The key feature upgrade is the zip front entry which is makes putting on and removing waders far easier and makes mid-fishing bio breaks much more convenient. If the sun comes out and temps rise you can either open up the front zip for more airflow or you loosen the should straps and drop the torso section to your belly button area to easily convert these waders into effective wading pants. 
The second major feature is the fleece lined hand warming pockets in the front of the waders. You don't know how fantastic a feature this is until you have it and I can't imagine going back to no pockets.  The ability to take the edge off of your cold hands while fishing makes the experience all the more enjoyable. 
Patagonia also updated the styling of the waders in a few major ways. Colors shifted from taupe (graiege) and olive to a clear two-tone light gray and dark gray. This results in a much cleaner look. They have also shifted branding to the Fitz Roy Trout logo which I believe is one of the single coolest marks in the outdoor space. Its clean and gets a clear message across and I love that I can wear it like a badge. 
On the ""areas for improvement front"" I would recommend some kind of attachment station on the front of the wader for retractors and potentially a small velcro or foam station for attaching flys. Otherwise these waders are expertly designed.

Overall, I could not be happier with this wader and I am proud to continue to wear Patagonia products. I sent in my old pair of Rio Gallegos waders to Patagonia to be fully repaired so I now have a pair of guest waders for visitors rather than tossing more in landfills. I had personally patched many holes from crossing barbwire fences (one day I will learn) and general wear in my old waders but always ended up mildly damp from pinhole/weeping leaks. Patagonia is good enough to fully inflate my waders and get them back to proper working order.

This is my first pair of 'premium' waders, so I can't compare them to high-end Simms, just mid range Redingtons. 

Overall, I'm impressed by the fit and finish. Fit was very important to me. I'm 5'-6"", 130lbs, so it's tough to find decent fitting waders. I had tried on the previous generation of the Rio Gallegos Short and found them to have so much excess fabric around the waist and a$$. This new version isn't slimmer or fitted, it just has a little less material, and distributes better across the top half of your body. The bottom half materials feels thicker, but is also cut and seamed in a way that it doesn't  bunch awkwardly or restrict movement. They feel solid moving through the brush. Also the booties fit much better in this generation. 

I don't love the two pockets that flank the zippers. They're too shallow to be useful for storing anything, not to mention you can't really get your whil hand in there to keep them warm. It's like they were designed to hold a granola bar and that's it. 

Some people may like the Cellphone pocket, but I find it a little clumsy and a pain to access. Since its not detachable, I may just cut it off. 

Lastly, for what it's worth, each wader has an individual number stamped on the inside. I don't know if other brands do that, but it's reassuring to thank of this as a high end piece of equipment that someone has individually considered and tested.

"Patagonia","Rio Gallegos Zip-Front Wader - Men's","618355964",5,"Patagonia has really stepped up the wader game with the 2016 version of the Rio Gallegos. If you've owned Patagonia waders before and have experienced fit issues, you're not alone. Not to worry though, Patagonia has remedied the fit and the 2016 line seems to be spot on. Chest, inseam, and bootie sizes all seem to be on point with the size chart Patagonia has provided allowing you to get into the right size right off the bat. 

Fits in the body but not in the booties? No worries, you can send your waders into Patagonia and they can replace them for you so that you get the perfect fit from your waders. 

The Rio Gallegos waders are full of features and creature comforts that come in real handy on the river. Recently really put the hand warmer pockets to use on a 22 degree 6am start time, boy those were nice, too bad I couldn't fish with my hands in there. Patagonia has kept the waders simple which I appreciate. There are only two external pockets on these guys which are sizeable and able to hold more than I have ever had the need to put in there; wallet, chaptstick, cigar, etc... Waterproof cell phone pocket on the inside is real nice although hard to get at when you have a fish in the net and are trying to snap a pic to put on the gram so I usually end up keeping mine in one of the front pockets. I find the internal cell phone pocket a great place for my license. 

No GoreTex? No problem. Differing from the Simms G4 (Rio Gallegos equivelant), Patagonia uses their proprietary H2NO waterproof breathable membrane which works great! Too many times you get the storm going on inside the waders which can make for an uncomfortable day on the river. Although I've only used these in the winter I have done some serious trekking in them to find the fish and I have yet to experience too humid an environment in there.  H2NO also helps keep the price competitive. 

One of the best wader innovations of all time is the full zip. No more will we piss on the internal tool pocket of our chest waders! It's about time! I feel that a lot of people are skeptical of the waterproofing of a zipper when submerged underwater... not a problem here! I waded into nipple deep water just to give her a test and she nailed it. Stood in there a good two or three minutes and I was dry as a bone. The zipper can be a little difficult to maneuver up and down, but I'll take that any day over having water in my pants. Seems to be getting easier every time I take them out and still no water infiltration.

Some other great features on these waders are the suspenders and the knees. You can unlock the suspenders and slide the chest of the waders down turning these into wading pants. Super nice on those cold mornings that turn into warm afternoons. The knees are articulated super well so that when you are bending down to lay hands on the hog you just plucked from the depths or searching for that fly you just dropped, the waders don't ride up on you and get tight in the crotch. They also come with neoprene knee pads which make getting down on gravel a breeze, also a little added protection for those that are a wee bit accident prone. 

 Aesthetically speaking I like the two tone gray colors Patagonia decided on as opposed to the drab/army green from previous models. I also rather enjoy the Fitz Roy fish logo on the chest.  

The only thing I would change here would be adding some kind of external tool storage. Maybe a place for a zinger for my nippers or something like that. I generally keep that kind of gear on the shoulder strap of my sling pack but it might be nice to have a little spot on the waders themselves. 

All in all, these waders are absolutely amazing and I would definitely recommend them to any fisher person (expert and amateur alike)!

In 30 years, I have completely worn out two coats, have a third, and just bought the Triolet. We wanted to move up from a plain wrap shell and this coat does it without costing you much more. Pros, although it may not be Pro Gore-Tex, it definitely is durable. The placement of all the pockets is spot on. I never had a jacket with pit zips and they are sweet because you can really open up the jacket when you are working hard without actually taking it off. I deliberately took this coat out on an hour long heavy rain hike and was perfectly dry. The hood is so good it almost feels like a helmet without the pinch. All of the shock cord adjustments work perfectly and are attached to the jacket so you don't have a big line of shock cord hanging off the coat if it is cinched down. The only down side is the inside pocket doesn't have a zipper but it will hold a hat and gloves. The last thing I noticed is that even with the coat completely unzipped down the front, the coat is tailored so it stays close to the body, which means it doesn't get caught up in brush . I am looking forward to years of being able to stay outside in bad weather and actually enjoy it. Regarding size, I am 5'7"" but have a really broad shoulder. I have to wear large shirts. I ended up selecting an extra large jacket so I can wear this over anything. Some may call it baggy but I would describe it as a controlled loose fit.. The coat stays close to my body uniformly so it isn't like I have large flaps of material left over. I would buy the same size again without question.

It has almost been a full year now and I couldn't be happier. The Triolet excels at everything from skiing at A-Basin and ice climbing in Ouray to carrying 70-80 pound loads during high-country storms in the Sawatch. The fit is just baggy enough that I can get my hooded 750-fill down jacket underneath to layer on really cold days, but doesn't leave me looking like a skater/snowboarder when I use it alone as a rain jacket. It's cut long enough to fit under a harness, and the arms are long enough to allow one to reach up and swing a tool overhead without pulling the bottom of the jacket up. The high-quality material and huge pit zips let you dump heat when needed, and the hood is big enough to comfortably fit over a climbing helmet unless you cinch it down to keep that favorite hat dry. Expensive? Maybe, but it'll save money in the long run because this dude does a little bit of everything and seems like it will last forever. I work as a youth backpacking guide in the summers around Leadville, and this year it never left my pack, never got washed, and never let moisture in. After that eight week torture test and a wash, it still looks new.

"Patagonia","Dual Aspect Hooded Jacket - Men's","1758708449",4,"I got this, thinking it would be something akin to a Patagonia R1 hoody, but with the benefit of a hard shell's protection.  I'll tell you right now, it's not going to give you the insulation of an R1, and neither will it be as good with the elements as your typical $400+ hardshell.  What this closer resembles is a good softshell, with the added benefit of being remarkably trim.  

I had trouble at first figuring out how to make this work in my kit, and after some trial and error,  I've finally found my 'use' cases:

- For Climbing: the fabric is tough on the outside, so it can take some abuse.  Best for climbing when it's 35-50 degrees F outside and you're anticipating a little inclement weather. 
- For Jogging/Hiking: It'll block wind, but it's still breathable.  I love it for jogging, because it'll handle crappy weather with ease, and the slimmish fit moves well.  When it get's really cold, throw an R1 or maybe even just a Capilene baselayer underneath and you should be set.
- For Everyday Use: If it's brutally cold, but sunny out, I'd probably opt for your average mid-layer, like the Arcteryx LT Atom or Nano Puff, but if the temps are sitting around 40 degrees F and you think the weather will turn bad (notice a trend here?), either layer the Dual Aspect Hoody on top or wear it by itself.

MY ""SHORT"" GRIPE: Not so much the hoody itself, but more an observation of Patagonia - I don't feel like you guys consider the vertically challenged people out there.  The fit is great, but lengthwise, I feel like someone who's sitting around 5'10"" would probably call this garment a ""perfect fit."" For me, it always ends up being that about 2-4 inches of garment all bunched up around my waist.  My guess is that it's probably done that way so you can tuck it in your pants without it pulling out when your moving around, but considering the model they have on the Patagonia website doesn't have his tucked in or bunched up....","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-02-05 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

I purchased a small, which is a shade loose and not all that form fitting, but it's super comfortable. Ordinarily I wear an XS in most Patagonia items, but size up when I want a little extra room.

The grid material is a shade see-thru, simply because of the fabric technology (not because of durability or a poorly made product) - this just makes the piece more breathable, not to mention its construction contributes to the moisture-wicking and quick-drying performance, and therefore makes you more comfortable. 

It's intended to be worn as your first line of defense, and then layered atop if the conditions call for it (i.e. really cold skiing conditions vs chilly-ish trail running conditions).

"Patagonia","Lightweight Field Shirt - Men's","3876765",5,"New Mexico is a weird state. There's desert scrub and alpine ridges, often on the same hike. 1,000' of elevation gain in a mile is more of the norm than the exception. So I mean sure, you could go and fish the San Juan, shoulder to shoulder with all the other yahoos that just drive up and park right next to the river.

Or you can get out, get up, leave the crowds behind, and get into those wild cutties at 10,000'. That sort of blue line chasing is what the Patagonia Field collection excels at. The UPF factor and pop up collar keeps you from getting roasted at elevation. The lightweight fabric keeps you from overheating as you gain elevation while wearing waders. The tabbed sleeves let you work on your tan so your surfer girlfriend doesn't make fun of you quite as much, and the general burliness of the fabric helps protect you when you haven't seen a trail for miles.

I own two of these shirts now, and a pair of the Field Pants too. While I've used them extensively for fishing, with rolled sleeves and a pair of Stand Up Shorts you can totally get away with going to the farmers market and grabbing Sunday brunch without looking like too much of a tool. They travel in the bottom of duffels well and still look good when you pull it out. Quick drying is ideal for laundry in seedy hotel sinks, and I've even bagged a couple impromptu fourteeners while wearing them. 

I'm 5' 10"", 160# with broad shoulders and a long torso. I settled on size small, which is roomy enough for me to stick a mid weight base layer underneath while still loose enough to cast easily. The medium was baggy enough for me to stick a down jacket underneath it, which was a little absurd. If I have any complaints at all it's that Patagonia's sizing has been getting larger and larger. I realize most Americans (and certainly fly fishers) are fat, but come on, stay true to your brand. Seems like they're going in the right direction with the 2016 waders though.

Being just a 2L shell I was skeptical but, I have done a lot of cold summits with Patagonia's 2L shells before. This one performs and keeps her dry amidst any snow. Probably would get wet eventually in the rain but, she has a dedicated rain shell for that.

The amount of insulation is perfect! Its a bit much for her to tour in but, inbounds 30-40 degrees she can just wear the jacket with a good warm base layer. Colder than that she usually wears a lighter base layer and another insulating jacket.

"Patagonia","Piolet Jacket - Women's","505555921",5,"I gave this as a gift to my girlfriend earlier in the ski season and she loves it. 5'4"" 130lbs and she got the medium, fits perfect and cinches a bit in the waist to give it a really good look.

Being just a 2L shell I was skeptical but, I have done a lot of cold summits with Patagonia's 2L shells before. This one performs and keeps her dry amidst any snow. Probably would get wet eventually in the rain but, she has a dedicated rain shell for that.

The amount of insulation is perfect! Its a bit much for her to tour in but, inbounds 30-40 degrees she can just wear the jacket with a good warm base layer. Colder than that she usually wears a lighter base layer and another insulating jacket.

Any questions feel free to ask!

However, if you wanted to layer it over a long sleeve base layer you could stay pretty toasty as the jacket is very good with repelling wind and light rain. The only gripe I have is that I wish it had a tiny bit more give in the shoulder area. It can feel a bit restrictive when you cross your arms in front of you. That said my shoulders are pretty broad at 42 inches (31 waist). It's not a bad problem to have it just can be difficult finding clothes that fit well and offer range of movement. Maybe if the jacket had a hidden stretch panel somewhere it would fix that. A large was way too baggy on me and the sleeves were too long. It's also possible the jacket will stretch a bit and conform to my body. I've only had it a week, so time will tell.

I have this in an XXS.

FIT: The fit in this piece is consistent with the rest of Patagonia's slim fit pieces. Because my shoulders are a little broad/bigger compared to the rest of my body (I have more of a V-shape up top) and I also have longer arms, the sleeves are a bit short and the shoulders are a bit tight (yet I still have a bit of room in the lower torso). Despite this I still go true to size, and since I have a body type that's a little hard to fit and the discomfort is minor, no stars docked for fit.

PERFORMANCE: I mainly got this baselayer because I love Patagonia's merino baselayers--a lot. Maybe too much! And though I really adore my Thermal Weight Capilene, I have always preferred my Merino Midweight to almost any baselayer. So for me this was a real test just to see if Capilene could give merino a run for its money. The result: I was very, very pleasantly surprised. I went for a fairly intense hilly run in this and wore it for a total of around 48 hours (with about a single 8-hour air-out/dry-time overnight while I was sleeping and also wore it to bed one night) and was very pleased. The polygiene really did its job. While running and sweating, it did a great job keeping me dry and comfortable, but it was also light and thin enough that I could feel the wonderfully cool air. I started off wearing my Houdini as my shell and then ended with just the Capilene in 45-degree F weather. It was perfect.

BOTTOM LINE: Though I love merino, this sealed the deal for me on Capilene. I want to be able to have synthetic pieces that are versatile and can perform well during any objective, especially when safety (body temp/perspiration) is a real issue. This piece is going to play an important role in my layering system.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-10-24 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

I wanted to really put this to the test, so I used this running on a very windy and cold day. The wind was so cold I had to run back for a face mask.  I ran very comfortably in this shirt, with nothing over it. It blocked the wind enough and kept me warm, even though it's so very thin. I'm not sure how they do it, but it really does trap heat. I've since been using this skiing, as it breathes really well.  I've also been wearing it around the house a lot, just because I stay so comfortably warm in it.

I'm not sure about the fit. I'm usually a medium in shirts. I'm 5'8, 135lbs. I can wear small, but they typically aren't long enough in the torso, so medium is usually a good fit. I got the medium in this and it fits, but it's rather loose and quite long. I'm not sure if they meant for it to be loose, or if I should have picked up the small. I will definitely try the small, next time.  I like my base layers to be more fitted.

"Patagonia","R3 Hooded Fleece Jacket - Women's","106312630",5,"A friend of mine had been talking non-stop about how awesome her R3 was, so I figured as a Professional Fleece Aficionado I should weigh in on the whole situation. 

Reader's Digest Version: Hands down the fluffiest, coziest, easy-to-wear and thermally efficient fleece I have in my line up. 

Ages ago I picked up an R3 (orangutan orange mind you) and the high loft fibers shed all over everything I owned, leaving a very barren fleece - so I was a bit apprehensive of giving the R3 another go, but I'm so glad I did. The new and improved R3 touts a shorter fleece that doesn't shed, wicks away moisture, dries quickly, and assures warmth when you need it most. All in all, I love the fact that the R3 promotes cozy warmth while being incredibly lightweight and packable. Sometimes when I'm traveling, I roll the jacket up into the hood and use it as an impromptu pillow.

Perhaps my favorite part about this fleece is the fact that it's totally reversible! One side features a longer, loftier fleece for colder days, and the other has a shorter fleece for warmer days. Whoa, hello, imagine my surprise when I discovered that! One side has a chest pocket and the other has hand pockets. Additionally, my second favorite part about this fleece are the cuffs - super low-profile and slim without cutting off the blood flow to your hands (obviously crucial). 

My only beef is the oversized collar and hood, which I know is for helmet-compatible purposes and warmth and what have you, but it's a little bit much when you're wearing it unzipped. 

As for the fit, I picked up a Small, which is a big long and slightly relaxed, but I love it regardless. I think that if I were to purchase another fleece, I would go with an XS instead. For fit reference, I wear an XS in just about all Patagonia items, but can wear a Small when I'm looking to have a more relaxed fit. Additionally, I wear an XS in Arc'teryx and XS in Prana items.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-11-29 00:00:00","",""
"Patagonia","R3 Hooded Fleece Jacket - Women's","106248007",4,"I was hesitant in ordering this jacket as I wanted something packable for travel but just a bit softer and warmer than my nanopuff and reviews seem iffy. I ordered the  ultramarine thinking it seemed to be a versatile enough combo....
Upon receipt I LOVE the weight, comfort, and versatility of the jacket itself. There is a definite warmth variable depending on which side you wear out which makes it that much more functional. A few things to note, and maybe I just wasn't being that observant, but the hand pockets are only on the side without the chest pocket. They are NOT accessible from both sides!!!! I also ended up returning the ultramarine and ordering the rustic purple (which I haven't received yet) because the ultramarine is highlighter blue. It's kind of pretty with my blue shoes but it literally reflects that blue onto my face as if it were glowing which, due to my tan skin, makes me look reptilian and sick. Reflective highlighter blue is also very difficult to match with a pair of shorts/pants. This also makes it harder for use in a capsule wardrobe. On the other hand, if you are in the back country it would be FANTASTIC for not losing hiking buddies in the wilderness or flagging aircraft if necessary. Something to consider.

The multiple pockets and hood are lifesavers and it is so versatile, it can work as a midlayer but also as an outer layer & climbing coat. 

It is warm enough that I only needed to pair it with a capilene long sleeve tee on a 10miler in the Catskills in 40 degree weather.

Like all the reviews below me, there has rarely been a time in which that I've felt as though I needed to remove my jacket because I'm too warm. It consistently regulates my body temperature and offers a stellar warmth-to-weight ratio when I need it. The fit is pretty on point, and stays true to Patagonia's Alpine Fit, which is to say it has a slimmer fit than say the Patagonia Nano Puff or Down Jacket. Not only that, but this piece layers amazingly. This is pretty much my do-everything jacket (hiking, daily use, skiing, climbing, etc) and to say the least I'm obsessed with it. It does get a little on the stinky side, but it's synthetic and that's to be expected. I'm typically a size XS in Patagonia's products across the board, though sometimes I purchase a Small in the Alpine Fit to accommodate for more layering beneath the item in question.

I will speak to the fabric pilling as I've experienced this myself - I typically just tossed the jacket in the wash and that has absolved the pilling problem, though my husband has one as well and his has endured the pilling far more than mine has. We took a sweater stone to the material and thus far it's held up fine with no holes, though I can see it being problematic and potentially detrimental to the overall integrity of the fabric considering how thin it is.

With all of the negatives said, the main pocket and front hard pocket with fly patch are excellent.

I am just getting into fly fishing and plan to chase trout this fall when they are stocked locally. For now though, I fish for bass and sunfish. Recently went out in my kayak with only my fly rod , and decided to try putting the Atom Sling Pack over my PFD. Of course, I had to sit a little awkward to make it comfortable, but I could make it work! Now for the important details: I really like the Atom Sling! Why? Versatility. This pack can be used in so many different ways. When using it as designed it spins around to the back  so that when standing in my kayak, I almost forget I'm wearing it. Then when sliding it to the front so I could make tackle changes it was very easy to access all the pockets. Since I am just starting, I am still experimenting with how to set the pack up, and again, it's so versatile there are lots of options. I liked having the tippet holder on the outside so I could have immediate access to pull some line off. Since I don't have that many flies yet (1 large and 1 small pack and neither is close to full) I did not come anywhere close to filling up the inside of the pack. In my research before purchasing I was very concerned about getting just the right size, not too big or small, and I think I nailed it! I look forward to more time on the water so I can refine my setup, especially when I take my first trout trip this fall!
 I also foresee using this pack for short hiking trips. Having good storage, a place to carry water, etc. I think it would make a great hiking pack! At least for the short trips that I would take. It would also work great for a day at an amusement park. It's so light and comfortable. 
 In closing, I will say this was my first purchase from Backcountry. Their service has been great! My Gearhead (they assign you a ""personal Gearhead"" to follow up and see if you have questions, problems, etc.), Sam Hurst, has reached out several times to follow up and make sure I am satisfied with my purchase, see how I am using it, ask if there is anything he can help with. At first I was skeptical of the whole idea, but now I think it's a great way to stay in contact and give great customer service. When I placed the order I had reached out through the online chat with a question and received the same great service then. I am really impressed!

"Patagonia","Stealth Atom Sling","4435707",2,"After researching and trying on several sling, chest and hip packs for fly fishing, I decided that the Atom Stealth Sling had the best features for what I was looking for. My criteria was: enough room for a few fly boxes, small tackle and tool holders, water bottle holder large enough for a nalgene, clip for a net, enough extra room inside for a packable rainjacket, small camera and snacks and above all COMFORT.
While I tried this sling on without gear, it is extremely comfortable, but fully or even partly loaded this sling is literally a pain in the neck. It is not only uncomfortable, but it constantly slides of my shoulder, even with the cross strap buckled. The only way this sling can be worn correctly is on your right shoulder, which is my casting shoulder. Why most sling packs are made to rest on your right shoulder is puzzling, as most people are right handed casters.
I since switched to a hip pack with a strap that can worn on either left or right shoulders and hope to have better luck with this. The sling pack would normally end up on the bank and I couldn't wait to take it off at the end of the day.
Out of all the sling packs, I think this one has the best features, but I would highly recommend finding a shop where you can try one out, fully loaded, while demoing a rod. Good luck.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-09-06 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

Main Pocket: The thing looks small, but is a modified day pack - keeping the bulk over your back and out of the way (and water) to provide the freedom to cast, retrieve, fight, and land fish.  I can go all day with it on, meanwhile holding 2-3 fly boxes, Steripen (water purification), a day's worth of snacks, compartment for your shades, sun screen, Ultrathon bug repellent, and a 32 oz Nalgene (seen at the bottom).  The phone pocket is too small for an iPhone 6+ but should be fine for just about any smaller phone.  There's a loop at the top where you can stick a magnetic net release to make for easy landing (pictured is the small, Wetfly Catch & Release net).
Tying Table (outside of the main pocket):  Changing flies out is pretty slick too.  All you need to do is unbuckle the bottom strap and flip the sling around.  Then open the tying table compartment where there's plenty of storage space for tippet, strike indicators, weights, nippers, etc.  Within the tying table is a foam pad to dry out used flies.
Along the Strap: There's a small compartment that'll hold small things such as chapstick, cigar, or gum and has loops on the outside to secure forceps and other fishing tools to keep handy while fishing.

"Patagonia","R1 Field Fleece Pullover - 1/4-Zip - Men's","106692603",3,"I bought this fleece instead of the standard r1 because I kept seeing reviews that said the r1 isn't that durable and pills excessively, and I wanted a fleece that would be good for rock climbing and could handle a beating.
Overall, I'm not very impressed with this version and I wish I had gone with the standard r1. 
The r1 field's reinforcement panels add quite a bit of bulk and stiffness, making it less packable, and the horizontal pocket is very difficult to open with one hand (however the horizontal pocket can be friggin sweet because it perfectly fits a beer can! So awesome around the campfire!). One if my biggest problems with it is the sleeve cuffs; since I hoped to use this for rock climbing I needed to be able to pull up the sleeves to keep my hands free from obstruction. I see people do this with the r1 all the time, but with the r1 field the reinforcement panels make the sleeves stiffer and not stretchy enough to pull up and keep in place. The stiffness and looser fit also make this jacket less convenient to layer. It just doesn't feel right underneath my nano air or hard shell, and the sleeves bunch up.

This jacket did not meet my needs, but with that being said I do think it is a good jacket. It would be good for manual labor outside in colder weather, or for other outdoor activities but in my opinion it does not make a good layering piece and it's not good for rock climbing. 
Since getting this jacket I've talked to many of my friends with r1s and the pilling and durability never seem to be a problem. If you're thinking about getting this jacket for layering or climbing, go with the r1 hoody or standard r1 despite what some reviewers say about durability. I think Patagonia tried to fix something that wasn't broken with the r1 field. The r1 is the gold standard for a fleece layer for good reason, and Patagonia will always repair and replace damaged gear, so I wouldn't recommend the r1 field.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-05-31 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

When I received the jacket I was surprised by how much structure the jacket has for a fleece, or what some other reviewers are referring to as its stiffness.  I'm guessing that the stiffness is due to the windproofing, and it makes the jacket feel more like a wool or leather jacket than a fleece.  It feels comfortable, it just may be different than what you're expecting.

My problem with the jacket is that it does not breathe at all.  Of course a fleece that is windproof won't breathe like a regular fleece, but wearing this jacket is like wearing a sauna suit.  After walking a couple blocks in this jacket I'm sweating like crazy, and I've never experienced this before in anything besides really cheap junky nylon jackets.

I like the silhouette on this little number. But what works best is that it can be both dressed up or dressed down, depending on your evening itinerary. Slap on a pair of cowboy boots, and you've got the perfect line dancing attire. Add flats for a casual yet classy look at work. Add a tank for a hot summer stroll. 

Patagonia is a brand I love to invest in because I know their clothing lasts a good long while, and they aren't prone to going out of style.

"Patagonia","Strider Short - Women's","106312630",5,"Reader's Digest Version: A barely-there, quick-drying short for long and short runs alike. 

Non-Reader's Digest Version: I'm in love. Like, love-love. I have last year's version of the Strider and WHOA that short is tight and hello-booty-everywhere (that being said, they're great for tempo training or really hot days). However, I'm happy to report that the fit has changed and this year's edition is far less tight and is much more comfortable. I wear an XS in last year's edition (which is a little tight, but not obstructive) and I bought an XS in this year's edition and it's like, perfectly flowy in the thighs but fitted (but not tight) in the waist band. The tie waist is a nice touch. 

The fabric is SUPER quick-drying and soft. Last night I took them on an 8-mile run in 100-degree heat and yeah, I was sweating a lot (i.e. my butt looked like I had sat in a puddle), but the fabric dried within a minute of getting saturated (maybe even less). The fabric didn't chafe and the perforated inserts help bolster breathability. 

Also, the liner is so, so soft and offers a barely-there feel. Like, I wish that liner was in every single pair of my shorts. It didn't ride up, chafe, or obstruct mobility. It was just perfect.

I love the little pocket addition, it's super convenient for gels, house keys, or doggy-doo bags. 

I'm 5'3"" or so, and the inseam is short, but not too short that I'm uncomfortable. I prefer the shorter lengths since longer shorts often chafe funny on me.

My only suggestion to Patagonia is to offer the Strider with a split leg. It's a really nice detail that I didn't realize how much I loved until I bought a pair of shorts that had it. 

Bottom line: I'm totally in love and will most likely be buying another pair because they fit so well, are so quick-drying, versatile, and suhh-hhoofffttttt. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-07-07 00:00:00","",""

I honestly loved them so much, I bought and hoarded them like Elaine bought and hoarded sponges on Seinfeld.  But, Pearl Izumi has moved on with new styles and frankly that doesn't always mean ""better"" to me.  So I set out to explore the possibilities.  I have tried several shorts now from Pearl Izumi, Hoka and Patagonia.

Here's what I really like about the Patagonia Strider.  It provides a nice tight but not-so-tight fit.  I like all my goods to stay in the same place.  But I don't want to be choked either.  Patagonia Strider won that battle against the other brands.  I really like the 5 in inseam, but some shorts with 5 in inseams seem to look a hell of a lot short than that.  Patagonia was right where I expected it to be.  Lastly, I have muscular legs and I really want to know that the shorts give me lots of room to move in all directions - especially when trial running.  Again, the Patagonia Strider took the trophy.  

I have not yet tried the pockets.  They are deeper than I expected, but I am cautious about the unclosable opening.  I tend not to like to carry much in the pockets of my running shorts other than possibly a car key (the Strider does have the small zipper pocket on the back like most shorts do).

After hundreds of miles in the Nine Trails shorts, I'm still in love. I just bought my second pair (the Navy blue). I didn't buy a second pair because the first ones have had their time, but because they're easily my favorite running shorts and I can laundry only so many times a week.

After 8 months, they're even softer and more comfortable than when I did my first run in them. The liner hasn't stretched out (I can't stand when shorts do that), the zippers still work phenomenally, the color (black) has faded a touch but that's probably from all the time I've spent in the sun with them.

FIT & PERFORMANCE: I am a big fan of the boy short style, and Patagonia definitely hit the nail on the head in terms of coverage. The length is just right, and they cover my bottom entirely, which is nice because a lot of ""boy short"" styles tend to be more ""cheeky”; yet, they are not low-profile, as the edges of these shorts DO show through yoga pants or tight jeans. I have the matching bra which I do wear 1-2 times a week on average, and really like the matching, interesting patterns. The same fabric is used in both of them, which is excellent in terms of its ability to dry quickly, and my bra has lasted through many washes and a lot of activity, so I imagine the same would go for the fabric on the shorts.

However, for me, the crotch rides up after a short time wearing these while doing exercise or other more intense activities like climbing or slacklining, which makes them very uncomfortable. Walking to the store and back, they tend to feel good and stay put, but otherwise, I don't get much mileage out of them.

I think part of the problem is both the varying fabric pattern and the location/type of the seams. The fabric pattern on the majority of the boy short is very stretchy and soft, but the fabric pattern (or gauge, perhaps) on the crotch is tougher and much less stretchy , which makes it feel tighter than the rest of the short. For me, it feels quite restricting. The stretchiness of the rest of the short feels great when moving around a lot, but it seems like this aids in the shorts riding up elsewhere. 

For me, the diamond crotch seam pattern on their Velocity Race Shorts doesn’t ride up and has a more natural feel, and you often see that type of seam in yoga pants, probably because the seem type/placement makes much more sense for us ladies (the seams tend to better follow our anatomy rather than run against it).

If you think these might work better for you than they did for me, I'd suggest buying this previous model that is on sale (or using a coupon to buy the new model) before committing to an expensive pair of underwear you might not like. It looks like the new model doesn't differ in the crotch style but rather in the thickness of the waistband (which wasn't a problem for me as it wasn't constricting).

The attached pic should show the comparison of the seam style in Patagonia's Velocity Race Shorts (in catalan coral) versus the Active Mesh Boy Short (in radiant magenta).","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-02-20 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

The Barely Bra has been one of the better bras I have owned. I am small chested, so I don't have to worry about needing a lot of support. I have worn this bra running, biking, to the gym, and practicing yoga. Honestly, I wear it under casual clothes as well because it's so comfortable. The cutout detail is really cute and can add to an outfit if it happens to stick out as opposed to other bras that just look too sporty. I currently own two and definitely plan on getting more.

"Patagonia","Barely Bra - Women's","1360692926",4,"This bra is is so thin and light you really do forget you're wearing it. The modesty cups are a nice shape that lay seamlessly against you, so you can't see the edges of them through the bra or a thin shirt. The split straps in the front offer a pretty little detail, so that you don't have to worry about keeping it totally covered up. I got this in the big sur blue for that reason - many of the other colors seemed to light or pastel-ish to allow to peek out of tanks or tees. Too much like underwear. The brighter color makes it seem fun and intentional - cuz lets face it, with all the strappy yoga tops and whatnot, when do you ever find a bra that actually has the same shape as the straps in a top anymore? 

I'm 5'1"" and 110lb. I used to wear a 34 B at VS, but discovered within the last year that a 32 C is a much better fit - it allows me to hook the smallest adjustment which is somewhere between a 30-32. Having said that, I think that anyone smaller around than me would probably want to try the xs instead of the small. I ordered the small, and the chest fits nicely, but it can be a bit skitchy around the middle. Doesn't move enough to bother me, but it's something to keep in mind if you're slightly on either side of those measurements. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-20 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

My last comment is that to look at the name of products you buy; in this case, 'Baggies'. They are not meant to look and fit as other shorts out there. When you sit, they become baggy in the front/crotch area. This doesn't bother me at all, but realize this when you go to buy them.
I have  found the size to be true to other brands sizing. I have a more athletic build, so the Large that I bought fits my rear as I would like it too. The tie on the top helps suck in the elastic if you have the slimmer waist as I do.

The hubs owns two pairs, one with a 28 waist and another in a 30 waist and just about lives in them come summer - basically waffling between his Baggies, running shorts, and the Stand-Up shorts. He does agree that these fit a little more snug (in the waist) than the average 29 / 30 waist, hence owning the two different size options. The thighs do flare out, but they're not offensively large by any means (granted, that's my opinion). For size reference, he's 135lbs, 5'9"" and wears a Small in Patagonia bottoms and wears a 29 in Levi's.

And while I know there's a version out there for women, I bought a pair of the men's 28 waist, 5in inseam for myself and they fit great. I often like the fit of the men's shorts a little more, especially when they feature a classic rise. The rise hits my natural waist and is a shade relaxed, but super comfy. The fit in the legs is super comparable to my beloved, classic Baggies, which I much prefer in comparison to the tight fit of most women's shorts. I'd rather not waste my time yanking on my shorts.

"Patagonia","Strider Pro Running Short - Women's","106312630",5," I love me a comfortable pair of running shorts, and throughout the years I've amassed quite a few pairs of Patagonia's running shorts. They've definitely struggled with the fit in the past (too much fabric in the front pelvic area which leads to bunching and chafing, or heavy zippers on pockets that weigh you down), but in the past 2 - 3 years they've made some awesome advancements and the Strider series is evidence as such.

So, admittedly, I was a shade skeptical when I saw the new Strider Pro make its debut on the website: I wasn't super enticed by the shorter inseam or the new pocket configuration. I've been singing the praises of the 2015 edition and pretty much live in them once warmer temps come 'round, so I was a bit bummed about the new updates mostly because I love the old design so much. 

However, if there's anything I should glean from Patagonia's most recent batch of products, it's that change IS a good thing. That being said, these changes, ooh they good, baby! I'm surprisingly impressed despite my original, stodgy impressions.

SLC had a brief bout of spring-ish weather, which I figured would be a smart time to give these the Good Ole College Try. I run a mixture of road and trails, though I much prefer trails and largely rely on road for training / when I'm in a time-crunch. So, I figured I could get a solid ""Initial Impressions"" feel if I took them on a 5-mile road cruise. I paired them with a lightweight merino wool shirt and a nano air vest and was extremely comfortable. The shorts have a very barely-there feeling and were a treat to run in.

That being said, these are my Initial Impressions Thus Far: 

1. I'm really, really digging the waist band! It has the reinforced elastic on the interior, much like Patagonia's baselayers do, so the short sits higher up on your natural waist rather than being super low-slung. 
2. The fabric is pretty much the same, if anything it might be a shade more lightweight and therefore more quick-drying. We'll see how this performance actually pans out come hotter weather since 54 degrees isn't exactly, well, soggy bottom sweat inducing. 
3. The pocket configuration is aacccuuuttually pretty nifty, albeit I didn't use all the pockets, which I rarely do in my elder Strider Pro shorts either (I dig me a solid hydration / snack holster vest).
4. The inseam isn't all that different than the originals, however it still is a pretty short inseam so that's something to keep in mind when ordering this short.
5. The built-in liner seems to fit differently and more comfortably. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but it's better. Certainly won't complain about an updated built-in liner, that's for dang sure.

Fit Impressions:
I waffle between a Small and XS in Patagonia's fit. However, I'm noticing as of late I'm more of a ""true fit"" XS, but can wear a Small if I want the product in question to have a more ""relaxed"" fit. I have a small in the OG Pro Strider and they fit perfectly, so I picked up a Small. The Small is definitely a relaxed fit on me, but a comfortable one for sure. The waist band has an adjustable tie, so I'm able to cinch the shorts down comfortably. I'm not sure I would want the XS simply because I don't like my running shorts to feel super snug in the hips, especially when they're supposed to be light and airy. That being said, excess fabric can do some damage while running, but I'd venture to say that the relaxed fit on this short won't chafe or cause hot spots. I'll update the review once hotter weather comes around, for sure.

All in all, I'm surprised at how stupendous the updates actually were. I'm really, really looking forward to taking these out for a longer rabble-rouse come warmer weather.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-02-23 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

The side panels really vent and the best feature of all is the SNAPS!!! Oh snap! No more fooling around with buttons with cold fingers at 5am in the morning in the tent! The snaps seem very durable and work awesome. Okay now for sizing - I feel this shirt runs big. I ordered a medium and it is a little big on me which is ok since I like it that way for backpacking.

This skort has a feel-good design. I'm unbelievably stoked that there's a well-fitting skort out there built for hiking, travel, and beyond.

The fabric is lightweight, stretchy (yet durable), and dries quickly, so I'm able to lunge, high step and even cartwheel should my little heart desire it. There's an internal drawcord, allowing me to really batten down the hatches. The side pocket is great for gels or granola bars, too. 

My most favorite part of this skort is the built-in liner. I was not expecting the built-in shorts to be as well-fitting as they are. That being said, the built-in shorts are NOT booty shorts or a brief liner: they are a true, mid-thigh short on me, which in turn prevents thigh chafing and discomfort. For me, that's been my biggest beef with other skorts: the liners are always riding up, too tight, and way too short to actually serve a purpose. However, the Happy Hike Skort has me coming back for more.

As for the fit: I probably could have gone with an XS, but I went with a Small as I wanted to avoid the whole ""pinched hips"" sensation that sometimes occurs for me. The Small is definitely relaxed on me, loose in the elastic, but this allows me to comfortably wear the skort on my natural waist rather than awkwardly low-slung.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-07 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

"Patagonia","Active Sports Bra - Women's","4057022",4,"Size ref: I am 5' 4.75"", run between 108-112 lbs. and carry my weight in my bottom half, and have a wider torso in relation to my cup size--I'm about a 34AA-34A (actually between 33 and 34) and take a size 0/XS dress size. I have this bra in a size small. I've had it for probably just under a year and have worn it in the ballpark of 100 times, 1-4 times a week (depending on when I'm in the swing of doing certain activities like climbing).

FIT & PERFORMANCE: the fit is rather unique; I don't have any bras that fit the same way, and I'm not quite sure if this bra in a small could fit women who have a B/C cup and above. I have a pretty small cup size and even I feel occasionally smushed, though the medium was too big of a step up for my cup size (but not for my ~33-34 bust measurement). The good thing about this is that, despite the fact I don't have much, well, *jiggle*, everything stays put and I never have to worry about bouldering on ceilings when people can easily see down your tank top. One odd thing I notice about the bra, though, is that it tends to shift downward on my body as time passes (throughout the day). It doesn't bug me all that much and it tends to feel a little more comfortable if I tug it downward a little when I put it on. I really love the position of the straps, and they don't feel like they cut into my body at all. However, the bust line is very tight on me, to a point where it's quite uncomfortable to put on and take off the bra because it doesn't stretch nearly as much as you think it might if you've ever felt the stretch in Patagonia's Active Mesh Boy Shorts.

CARE: I wash the bra probably every 3-5 times I wear it depending on the activity, though it has actually never once smelled funky, since it does breathe very well. Sometimes it looks stretched out after a use, but every time I put it on, the fit feels like it always has. It does not stretch or shrink whatsoever after a cold cycle wash (or hand wash) and a line-dry, which I think should be a number one factor when looking for a bra--what's the use of a bra that changes sizes after the first time you wash it? The radiant magenta has stayed perfectly radiant, but it has collected a few fuzzies/pills of other garments' materials I wash it with.

BOTTOM LINE: Despite this bra being quite tight, I do love it for climbing, running, bicycling, etc., or when I want something that doesn't show any bodily details through a tight t-shirt or tank top. I wear it with my Patagonia Layering Racerback and the straps show through the keyhole in the back in a very cute way. I'm on the fence about purchasing another one, and am kind of holding out in hopes that I stumble across something that is a little more forgiving for athletic builds, especially for female climbers who have muscles that simply seem to' get in the way' with a lot of bras. If Patagonia adds a little bit more stretch and perhaps a couple sizes more related to cup sizes (i.e., how more 'normal' bra sizing works), I think it'd be quite a hit!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-02-22 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Patagonia","Baggies Stretch Short - Men's","107192437",5,"So I've had a pair of these stretch baggies for over a year now, I really wanted to put these to the test before I gave a review of them and I have to say they're pretty great! Now I'm 6'5 and I wear between a 34""-36"" inseam for pants so I've got some pretty long legs, I'm also a college athlete and so don't let my elongated frame deceive you I have some annoyingly large quads and these shorts accommodate my non-standard legs almost perfectly. As you can see in the picture, when worn below the natural waist, where I feel like most guys wear their jeans, these shorts are only about an inch or two above my knees when standing. So basically as far as fit goes, whether you're a bean pole, or squat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, these shorts should fit you well. Now as far as materials and durability I really like the little bit of stretch these provide as I think they keep things from getting uncomfortable in any position, which is great for climbing, and hiking. I also like that these shorts forego mesh liner found in other baggies models. My only concern with these shorts is that I'm not sure if they're as durable as  the original baggies, as I have had some threads pop around the pockets and it's only been a year. I don't think this will ultimately be too much of a problem because just because they aren't AS durable as original baggies doesn't mean they aren't still bulletproof as all get out. Overall I'm sure these shorts are going to be in my line up for at least the next decade and I'm still incredibly happy with them 10/10 would buy again.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-28 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

Swim trunks have a way of slipping down when they are wet. Had I known this string was going to be the pain that it is, I would not have purchased them. Also, the waist band material is a mesh of sorts that is rather rough and chafes when I do not have a shirt tucked in. But how often do you do that? Most of the time I am wearing a t-shirt outside of the short. On the plus side, and the thing that attracted me to the short in the first place, is the gusset, which is not easy to find.  The cut of the short is good, the placement of the pockets is, for me, excellent. I like to put my wallet in my left hip pocket and that is the side that has a zipper. And the cell phone pocket, too, has a zipper, which is great, though it would be better if the pocket were narrower. As it is, the phone can go horizontal and it can be difficult to retrieve in that position, especially when seated.

Basically, if I think a clothing item is rad I will wear it non-stop until my wife forces me to bath/change clothes.

Honestly, whether it is warm weather hiking, playing at the beach, or just being a bum at home - when the sun is out and the temps are warm these are my shorts of choice.

"Patagonia","Quandary Short - Men's","2004463",5,"Just got these the other day and couldn't be more pleased! A little on the pricy side but worth every cent. Great Patagonia quality material and a nice ""non-baggy"" fit. The pockets work out great for me, open pocket in the back for my phone and a little hip pocket for my car key. I'm 5'9"" and 149 lbs. and the size 32X10 works great...not too tight and not too loose. I purchased a Thomas Bates Hiker Belt separately for when I want a snugger fit. But haven't had to use it. Great purchase!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-12 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Patagonia","Denim Short - Women's","106761030",2,"I have been eyeing these shorts all spring and summer and finally went ahead and got them. I was so sad that they fit me weirdly! I ordered the 26, which fits perfectly around my waist (my usual pant size is 2), but the legs are so tight on my thighs! As a runner/weight lifter, these just aren't meant for muscular gals! The description says they are supposed to be relaxed, so my search continues for a good fitting pair of jean shorts! Super cute and love the fair trade/environmentally friendly aspect, though! If I sized up in these, the waist would be way too loose. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-08-01 00:00:00","I returned this product before using it",""

They feel durable.  I'd say they are loose fitting except for the waist, which I'd guess runs 1inch too small.  They do fit me well for what I was looking for.  Loose and casual for the beach and pool.  They have a single zipper pocket with a key loop inside.  Colors are OK.

I ordered my normal Patagonia size and these seem to be a bit smaller in the waist. Not a deal breaker, just not what I'm accustomed to. I like the length and the small pocket is an added bonus to store keys, etc. They seem to be fairly quick drying even in humid environments.  I'm 6'2"" and 195 lbs. and I ordered the 35's.
