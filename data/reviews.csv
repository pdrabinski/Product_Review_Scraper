"Patagonia","Nano-Air Light Hybrid Insulated Jacket - Men's","2133108",5,"I love my Nano Air hooded jacket but most of the time it is overkill in the warmth department and I end up using it as an insulating outer layer. The Nano Air Light Hybrid is perfect middle ground piece for moving fast with big efforts in the cold or just chilling at work when something more than a t shirt is needed.

 On cold days I am able to use it backcountry skiing over a baselayer layer on the skin up and then pop an insulating jacket or shell over it on the way down. If transitioning fast it insulates well enough to even forego the insulating layer on the way down and just roll with it as the outer layer. When it's sunny and a little warmer I'll skin up in a base layer and add the Nano air light for the down.  I'm always surprised at how wind resistant the chest area is in relation to how well it breathes! That is the magic of multiple materials placed in strategic places. In addition to backcountry skiing I use it nordic skiing on cold days, fat biking (heaven forbid),  cold bike commutes as an mid or outerlayer, etc etc...
 I love the contoured fit and at 5'9' 150 lbs feel the size small was tailor made for me. I often wear it at work in the clinic on cold mornings and never end up taking it off because it regulates temperature  so well.

"Patagonia","Nano-Air Light Hybrid Insulated Jacket - Men's","1230244",5,"I typically run hot when active and cold when stopped. The original nano air was too warm for me while active. I have also owned a 40 gram primaloft gold jacket with fleece side panels (ala Atom LT) and found it didn't breath well enough on the back panel when active.

The nano air light is a great piece for me in that it's a medium boost of insulation when worn over other layers, or much warmer under a wind breaker. Since I typically am wearing a pack less insulation on the back is appreciated. I consider it to be a much more versatile fleece (can't get much out of a fleece over a windshirt). 

Some examples of use:
*Ice climbing WI4-5 pitches with a thin t shirt and grid fleece around -10 to -5F. Used a thin windshirt over the top during windy approach and on easier approach pitches.

*Ski touring with no base layer at 27-30 degrees. Just to test breathability. Would sweat a bit in the front with zip down. Threw a hard shell over the top only and the whole jacket was dry and warm to the skin by the base of the run.

*Ski touring insulator for the ride down. I'll typically tour up in a very thin synthetic t or long sleeve and need more for the ski down. The nano is the perfect touch of warmth. Easier to slide on fast than any of my fleece mid layers. Dries out the base layer very fast when I do sweat on the up, especially in the back.

*Hiking and cragging in 40-50 degrees. It offers a boost of warmth on the flatter portions of approaches, if it's a steep uphill I would still strip down to a t-shirt. While cragging moderate rock with temps around 40 and some light wind I left the  nano on, did not overheat climbing and was just comfy while belaying. 

I see myself bringing this along for alpine climbing in the summer. On the descent of routes I think it will be a perfect boost of warmth over a windshirt. Since I can pull it on and off quickly it's much more versatile than taking a windshirt on/off to get a fleece underneath. 

My only gripe about the piece may be specific to my build, but it's shared with a lot of climbers. I have relatively low body fat and ""popeye"" forearms, lots of veins close to the skin. My elbows and underarms have been cold when I wear just the nano light or have it over a windshirt. I wish they would have the waffle fabric cover the back, sides, and armpits only. I could use a little bit more warmth under the forearms. Minor gripe.

Fit: It feels trimmer overall, and is most noticeable in the waist and arm holes. The waist is fine for me, and had enough room for a t-shirt and wool baselayer.

To be clear, I still use this as my go-to around town jacket for fall and spring, but mid-winter you need to either add a shell over it or grab a normal puffy. 

The primary reason I bought this though, and the purpose it serves that makes it worth every penny to me, is for ski touring in the winter. Every other insulated jacket I ever owned I had to remove and put in my back at some point on my ski tour because even on the coldest days they would make me sweat. This jacket breathes so well that I can keep it on and fully zipped on most tours without getting excessively sweaty. Not only does that mean less over-heating on the hike, but I stay dry so I don't get as cold at the top of the hike either. Then I throw my shell on for the ski down, and with a shell over it this jacket is plenty warm.

I will use this jacket as an outer layer when it's not too cold, but agree that it doesn't block wind very well, and definitely doesn't block rain.

One has to be very deliberate to get them opened or closed with one pull. Annoying!

"Arc'teryx","Cerium LT Hooded Down Jacket - Men's","6329348",5,"Size:
I normally wear an XL jacket or shirt and this arcteryx jacket was no exception.

Fit:
Jacket has a great athletic style fit to it.  Makes even us ""soft shaped"" individuals look athletic!  Does not make you look like a marshmallow.  The high loft down means the jacket is quite thin and still warm.  Length and sleeves are perfect for me.

Function:
I brought this on a 4 day backpack trip to isle royale and it was just what the doctor ordered.  It packs down to about half the size of a Nalgene during the day (amazing).  At night you can unpack it and be comfortable well below freezing.  I wear it in winter with my arcteryx beta at hardshell when the weather really goes south.  

Quality:
The quality is outstanding.  The coat feels great. The zipper feels a little small to be durable, but they have never given me any trouble.  If they do, I have a lifetime warranty.  The coreloft around the chin, wrists, and pits is brilliant.  Depending on the activity you may break a sweat in this; you don't want that sweat to destroy your insulating capabilities.  For me I sweat and vent from the wrists and the coreloft holds up great there.

Cost:
I can not personally tell you if a $400 jacket is right for you.  I got mine cheaper from steep and cheap.  I was hesitant at first but have never looked back since I got my hands on the jacket.

Finally thoughts:
Do not bring this on  backpacking trip hoping it will double as your pillow.  850 fill power down makes for a terrible pillow.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-11-25 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Patagonia","Nano Puff Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","109542096",5,"For three years, this was my absolute go to piece, then I got the Patagonia Nano Air hoody and this Nano Puff has fallen to my second most reached for layer. 

While the Nano Air breathes quite well for a midlayer, this Nano Puff does not, which is sometimes a very good thing. I run hot, and if hiking or climbing in cold temps, I can work up a sweat wearing very little all the way down past freezing. So if on a climb, the Nano Air would be a much better choice for me at a belay station, where I'm subject to get chilly from the wind while I sit for maybe an hour. Similarly, while hiking, I may be in a tshirt or thin baselayer while moving, but when we stop to eat or regroup I want to trap all that heat I've worked for, and not let the wind steal it all. I still bring the Nano Puff for both of these situations.

The Nano Puff packs down incredibly small for a windproof, synthetic piece. That makes it a prime contender on summer backpacking trips to the alpine, where we know we may see freezing temps overnight or cold and windy storms during the days. While being coated with DWR, and windproof, this isn't a rain shell and will need to be layered properly in a downpour lest it wet out. Luckily, being synthetic, it'll still keep you warm when wet, but it definitely won't be comfortable and you'll have to wear it dry in your tent for hours.  This quality makes it an awesome emergency piece, a just in case safety net that weighs 3/4 of a pound but will cut wind or cold in any scenario. 

Mine has been incredibly durable, 5 years in now, with only a few small patches from wear and abuse. I take good care of it, but I don't baby it like I am known to do with some down jackets.

The fit on mine, again a model from many seasons back, is smaller than my Nano Air from 2015. The cut is a bit short, and the arms are too, but I still like the look more than sizing up and swimming in the chest. I'm unsure if Patagonia has changed the cut since, so can't speak to the newer versions. 

This is a great, practical midlayer that fills many holes in the wardrobe. It is not a breathable midlayer, if you keep that in mind, you will not be disappointed, as it will keep you warm and the wind at bay.

In my opinion this is a great 3 season piece. I take good care of my things but have definitely crammed it in a lot of packs and snagged it on rocks and it's held up well, and despite lots of compression I haven't noticed much decrease in warmth over the years.

It holds up well in the rain, both in water resistance and in loft and blocks wind fairly well, while still being pretty breathable. I hike fairly hot so will still get swampy in this unless it's say, summit day at Mt. Baker and it's cold and windy AF. 

It fits well though I could use a bit more length and/or a two way zipper for some extra length. I'm just over 6 ft and hover around 190-200 lbs and the M fits me well. Can't layer too much underneath but works as a great midlayer with a soft or hardshell too.

The jacket runs true to size (perfect arm length), his good shoulder dexterity, a decent lining that breathes, and most importantly: is durable. I wore this thing through a winter in the high desert and it was ideal. I've had no issues with abrasion climbing on rocks or moving under load on shorter hikes. 

Obviously not a good choice for long distance movement as it is heavy and doesn't pack well, and probably not the best for hardcore alpine ascents in wet/ below freezing conditions, but for short, semi-technical movements, it's perfect. 

After 6 months of use, I can say it is no worse for wear. Use some Nickwax and it retains a decent amount of water resistance. Not a huge fan of the sleeve cuff velcro fasteners, but they work well enough in warm weather. I'm assuming it was considered in the design of the jacket, so no points off. 

Overall - 
*4/5 as an all around  jacket

"Marmot","Tullus Down Jacket - Men's","2312342",4,"So I recently purchased 7 different down jackets so I could wear and compare and select the one I liked best. This was my great down jacket review, not because the review was great, but because the breadth of comparisons was pretty extensive. The ones I compared were the Marmot Zeus, Marmot Tullus, Mountain Hardware Nitrous, Mountain Hardwear Micro Ratio, Patagonia Down Sweater, The North Face Trevail, and the Outdoor Research Tanscendent. I'll put comments on the others in the listings for each. The reason I selected these are that they all are basically medium-weight down jackets (not extreme light or heavy) and were comparable on the prices. Backcountry was having a sale and all these were marked down to between $123 to $160.
What I wanted was a top layer jacket without a hood (don't use hoods very often). I generally don't use down jackets like these as a layer under anything because of their bulk. I prefer a synthetic for that. I have a huge down jacket with a hood for very cold weather. I wanted one that was less bulky and more suitable for activities.
So the Tullus. The Tullus was okay, but there were others that were better. The one I had was Skyline Blue and it's a nice looking color. The stitching on the jacket... something about the way the stitching goes down on the ends looked weird. 
Fit: The fit was good and normal. It wasn't so bulky that it restricted movement. The fit is regular and those who are used to athletic or trim fit may find it a bit larger than they are used to. But I thought it fit true to size. I have to get XL because of wide shoulders and long arms. The sleeves may not be long enough for guys more than a couple inches taller than me. The bottom of the jacket hit between the top of my pelvis and my hip joints. The fit looks good too. What I mean by that is that it doesn't look too square or too slouchy. I have a Marmot Quasar (ultra-light down) that is really square in the shoulders. As a result it looks kind of weird and pointy at the end of the shoulders. This one looks more natural.
Comfort: The jacket wasn't quite as comfortable as some but more than others. The fabric feels okay but doesn't feel as comfortable and quiet as some of the others I tried. The hand pockets are a bit more to the side than I would have liked and the openings could be a bit more angled. Neck and cuffs are basic but fine. 
I ended up returning the Tullus and choosing the Patagonia Down Sweater as it felt  a bit warmer, and lighter (800-fill down vs the Tullus' 600-fill down). However, this jacket is a fantastic value - it was $122. The Patagonia was $40 more. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-20 00:00:00","I returned this product before using it",""
"Marmot","Tullus Down Jacket - Men's","107793899",5,"This is a great jacket, here's why:
1.  Great value: I got it on sale for something like $125.  At that price it is a steal for the quality.
2.  Warm: not much to say about this.  It won't take you on an arctic expedition, but for the light weight, it is extremely warm.
3.  Quality: I believe Marmot is doing a great job with their products these days and this jacket is a great example thereof.  Only had it a couple months, but the initial quality impression is top notch.
4.  Weight: its light, but still warm.  Been my go to jacket this winter where temps have fallen to 0 degrees.  Its good on it's own down to about 30ish.  Below that, I include either a shell or another thermal layer.
5.  Fit: I'm about 6', 175 and the Medium fits me darn near perfect.  Nothing worse than short arms on a jacket.  No problem there as the arm length, I would say, is above average.
6.  Style: first day I wore it a friend said to me, ""Hey, where did you get that jacket?""  It looks great on!  I have the Steel Onyx color.

Highest recommendation.

PS - I first got the Marmot Zeus jacket that I returned because the outer fabric was too shiny for my tastes.  The finish on the Tullus jacket is quite matte looking.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-14 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Marmot","Tullus Down Jacket - Men's","107371815",5,"Me: 5'9"", 165 lbs., 32"" waist, long arms.

I bought this jacket for daily 1.5 mile walks in 35 to 55 degree, sometimes very windy weather in Minnesota.
I'm not kidding myself that this is a jacket that I can wear when the weather  gets too cold in Minnesota. 

I originally was looking at the Marmot Zeus jacket but that jacket appears to flare out a little toward the bottom and that kind of looks like coats that elderly ladies wear.

I bought the Tullus in Medium and it fits me GREAT.  The jacket is lightweight and doesn't restrict movement, and it keeps the wind out which is important to me because the route that I walk has zero protection from the wind in 3 directions.  I walk at a slightly fast pace and have not overheated in temps as high as 53 degrees, nor have I been cold in 32 degree, overcast, windy weather.

As I mentioned, this jacket fits great.  Marmot calls the fit of this jacket ""Athletic"" which means tighter at the shoulder and hem.  I am toned, but by no means skinny and there is still enough room in this jacket for me to wear a sweatshirt or even a thin hoodie underneath.  As I also mentioned, I have long arms; despite being 5""9"" tall, I am 6' from fingertip to fingertip, so I'm a knuckle-dragger, and I usually have problems with sleeves being too short when I wear Medium sizes.  The sleeves are perfect for me though and probably would fit well for people with regular arms also.  I can't say what the sleeves would fit like if you have alligator or T-rex arms though.

This jacket also looks great; I chose black and it is not too shiny or too dull either.  The collar can be worn down, up, or fully zipped up and each way is comfortable.  

Overall, I would recommend this jacket for the conditions that I mention above, especially if you want to look good while staying warm.  Props to Backcountry for the great price and getting it to me fast.

"Patagonia","Houdini Full-Zip Jacket - Men's","106622785",4,"I'm 5'11"" and and 175lbs. I ended up with the large - I likely could have gotten away with the medium also, but the fit of the large works well and isn't too tight fitting. I use this for trail running, mountain biking, hiking, and its great for travel as it packs up tight.

Pros: 
- Its seriously small when its packed up - it packs into its own pocket. Its barely bigger than the size of an avocado. Its easy to pack into itself, but has room that makes me think it could be even smaller if need be.
- The hood is great and can fit up and over a beanie no problem.
-  Like Kyle mentions below, it does fit in a fanny pack for mountain biking just fine. I'll one up him as I use the smaller Dakine Hot Laps pack and still have room for a tube, tools, and snacks in addition to the jacket. This is a cold wind / sporadic weather jacket that you can pull out of a nook of a backpack.

Cons:
- No other pockets than the small chest one, which I suppose is why its such a small jacket.
- Its got a DWR coating, but isn't a technical jacket.

I'm 5'10 180 and fit perfectly into the large. The Alpine Houdini runs larger, but this bad boy is true to size! 

Hit me up if you have any questions on the Houdini or any other piece of Patagonia gear out there... the brand is rapidly taking over most of my closet/gear space these days. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-05-25 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

I have both jackets in size L, but they don't fit that similarly.
 The Nano Puff has a nice 'boxy' fit that I've heard a lot of complaints about, but I think it is actually pretty rad. I like the loose fit because I think the jacket moves better and feels more mobile than it might if it were cut to fit more snuggly. 
The Nano Air is cut to fit more snuggly, and while that necessarily a bad thing, it is mostly cut to fit closely through the shoulders and chest - it is kind of shaped like a bell or a pear.
The Nano Air's face fabric is kind of soft and I think that it is a bit warmer than the Nano puff. That said, they are pretty comparable jackets. 
If you are looking into both and hoping to differentiate, I think it is probably worth going for whichever best suits your needs. I've heard that the nano air layers really well under waders for fishing or under a bib while skiing, but I think the Nano puff is better suited to climbing and the alpine.

"Patagonia","Nano-Air Insulated Hooded Jacket - Men's","109542096",5,"I'm entering my third winter with my Patagonia Nano Air Hoody and can honestly say this is a five star piece. It kinda makes me regret giving 5 stars to other pieces, because it may be the most loved piece in my kit. 

My Nano Air fills the need on so many days, it's unbelievable. I use it as jacket outerwear on days from 30-55 degrees, or even colder days when I'm just running to the store or to work. I layer a base underneath it for snow shoveling in almost any condition, as I know I'll work up a sweat in anything that doesn't breathe as well. I've worn it under a shell at the ski resort, or over a tshirt while skinning up on a tour. I've slept with it under my 35 degree bag on nights when the temp falls below freezing and this is the warmest layer in my pack. This piece has been to the top of over 20 mountains. It has also been to the beaches of California to warm me after swimming or surfing all day. 

It is incredibly cozy, sometimes I get home and just don't take it off. The face fabric feels more durable than a standard down puffy, or even the Nano Puff, but a nasty day of bushwhacking without a shell may push it to it's limit. That said, when hiking around off-trail, I'm not near as conscientious as I am with a down puffy. 

I have put at least 300 days in by now with my Nano Air, and would replace it IMMEDIATELY if it were ever lost, stolen, or somehow destroyed. It is so versatile it will usually end up in the bag because it does so many things as well as competitors, and a certain few (looks, breathability, comfort) significantly better.

If you're looking to buy a midlayer that is more than just a layering piece, look no further. Just know what this isn't, it isn't a standalone jacket for 20 degree days, and it isn't waterproof. My advice is to get a color you love, cause you'll be wearing it a LOT.

I am 6 feet, 160 ish with longer arms than I am tall, and I purchased a small. It's been perfect, as I never intended for this to fit over anything other than tshirts or merino/capilene baselayers. This is a midlayer that looks like a well cut jacket if layered over light clothing.

I work as a field biologist in arctic Alaska, studying cliff-nesting falcons. This often requires rappelling in to  their nest sites on extremely sharp, loose rock. We usually use rope protectors, but sometimes forget them and use one of our extra layers to protect the rope from the rock instead. This particular day, the only extra layer I had on hand was my Nano Air. I grudgingly placed it on the jagged lip of rock and ran the rope over it, and we went about our business. As we were finishing and pulling the rope, we were hit by a sudden frigid downpour and quickly gathered our materials and got out of there. A  3-mile slog later, soaked and freezing and exhausted, I realized with dismay that my prize possession, my Patagonia Nano Air was nowhere to be found. I whipped out the binoculars and there it was, shining lime green through the mist, stranded on the cliff face. Due to the nature of our biology project, we were unable to return to the site for 3 weeks. And there it stayed, exposed to the extreme elements of arctic Alaska, whipped by wind and pummeled by rain against the knife-edged rocks. I had written off all hope of retrieving this jacket, but lo and behold the three weeks went by and we found ourselves again at the cliff. Right where I left it, I picked it up and was amazed to find not a scratch on it.

As this is a mid layer or outer layer I can understand that it leaves a little room for layers underneath, but this jacket leaves a little too much room.  I wish I could try on a medium, but I've already worn this on multiple climbing trips and it wouldn't be right to trade it in now.  It does an excellent job keeping me warm when I'm not moving while at the same time it dumps excess heat when I'm actually climbing.  This is key as I don't have to adjust layers constantly.  I also like the mechanical stretch which gives me better range of motion when reaching or contorting my body into weird positions.  I also really like the double chest pockets.  I typically wear this with a harness on so the standard pockets are inaccessible.  The 2 chest pockets are great to store my phone and snacks.

I bought this thinking it would be a good high activity insulation piece in cold weather. I've used it while charging up hill on mountain hikes or backpacking trips. My initial impressions are that either it doesn't breath like it claims, or it's just too warm. In 30 degree weather I got very warm and quickly found myself wanting to switch to a fleece instead of the Nano Air. 

The cuffs are shaped awkwardly in that they don't taper like the comparable options from other brands, so you end up with too long of sleeves that bunch up into big puffy masses around your wrists. 

The lack of any hood adjustment on a $300 synthetic jacket is a big oversight. 

Overall I like the jacket, but not for $300. It's a good insulation piece at a relatively poor value. Can't help but feel like I paid for the brand name, which isn't even embroidered.

I bought this primarily as a cycling layer, but have used it casually a number of times as well. I bought this and the regular ferrosi, but ended up keeping this for a few reasons: trimmer fit, more durable fabric, and better chest pockets. 

The fit is trim but not tight, and has enough room for an R1 or other similar fleeces. If you want to layer something heavier like a down puffy, sizing up might be smart. The fabric blocks a reasonable amount of wind, but nothing compared to a hardshell or windstopper. I wanted something super breathable because I do run hot, and I can always add another layer. It's been in the 30's and my go-to is this plus a 200wt wool shirt for the ride into work. My favorite part is the double chest pockets with the mesh backing. They're super helpful for venting when it warms up in the afternoon and really were the feature that made me keep this instead of the regular ferrosi.

Given the chance, I'd change two things: the hood and cuffs. I prefer an under-helmet hood for jackets like these because they don't catch nearly as much wind when they're down. I would also like simple non-velco cuffs like the regular version. Both those are minor details, so still an awesome jacket.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-12-03 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

My body is incredibly terrible at thermoregulation. If I am not exerting myself I am usually freezing my butt off and as soon as I start doing any physical activity I am usually down to my base layers and sweating like a pig. On sunny day tours this isn't an issue as I just take my layers off. But if its a storm day I can't do this because I will get wet, which is both uncomfortable and a bit dangerous. All other shells I have used while touring in stormy, even my lightweight goretex rain shell, has left me a steamy sweaty mess on the up. 

The first storm day IN MY LIFE where I have been able to tour up with my shell on and be comfortable was with this jacket.  This jacket is immensely breathable but still cuts out the wind and keeps you dry. I am so impressed with this jacket good work OR!

Initial Reaction-
Upon opening up and trying on this I can tell they are serious for some mountaineering. This jacket had many pockets properly placed and with full waterproofing. It fit very well, with a little tightness in the shoulders. The convenient design of this jacket with its use of zipper, velcro and snap buttons, shows this is for some serious hiking and climbing. The material feels strong and capable.
-Zippers don't catch on anything
-Sturdy waterproofing on the zippers
-Well working hood with full head coverage
Sizing seems true, I ordered Medium which is what I usually wear and It fits perfectly, with good room for movement in the arms, and around the waist. All of this without it popping up too high while bending over. I feel well covered!
Two weeks in-
No complaints so far after regular use!
The waterproofing on this stuff is ridiculous! As expected from Gore-tex this material is extremely water repellent and hold up well under regular use in snow and rain. The hood can be very well secured under windy conditions and tightening elastics works well.
Conclusion-Amazing waterproof shell jacket for the price, that will surely work well years after purchase If properly taken care of.

After a couple of hours of wearing it during a drizzling rain storm with no problems, I gave it a much more challenging test. I continued to wear the jacket while tying down multiple kayaks to my truck's rack system under heavy rain conditions.  The most impressive part was that I was crawling around on the wet kayaks and even laying on my back putting pressure on the rain soaked kayaks/jacket and even then the water still didn't come thru the fabric.   I stayed dry and comfortable even under conditions where pressure was applied to the wet jacket's facing.  I even opened up the pit zips some to dump a little heat generated from the activity and water still didn't pass thru.   I have had many other ""waterproof"" jackets not hold up to that kind of a test.  Although I haven't tried it yet, I am confident that it will work great even while wearing a pack during a rain storm given the test I already put it thru.  Additionally, I had great freedom of movement while reaching up and around at awkward angles.  I typically wear a size large and this one was no exception.  It fits large enough that I have a decent amount of space for additional layers underneath during colder conditions.   I really like the collar on it and how it fits so comfortably with the hood up or down.  My only knock to it is that it could be quieter.   The fabric is rather noisy.  Still, I plan on taking it with me on backpacking trips where I am likely to encounter decent amounts of rain or snow.  It doesn't compress as small nor is it as light of an overall weight as another three layer gortex minimalist jacket I have, but this one has additional handy features like the pit zips and strategically placed pockets.

"Arc'teryx","Alpha SV Jacket - Men's","109171905",5,"I work as a professional outdoor guide in the peruvian Andes. I spend a lot of time in the mountains and I always need reliable protection. Over the years, I have tried several models of rain jackets from good brands like TNF, Columbia, Patagonia, etc. Let me tell you this: Today ARC'TERYX makes the best hardshells in the world. I was introduced to Arcteryx when I purchased the lighter ALPHA FL and it's performance blew my mind.

After that first experience I decided to buy the ALPHA SV. A few days ago, while having lunch at 15,420ft (4,700 mts) we were hit by a sudden storm. As soon I put the ALPHA SV on I felt like  was on a shelter. Later that same day, we got relentless hail, bittering cold winds and a heavy downpour. This jacket feels like wearing a 16th century armour. YES. It is that good. It  makes you feel invulnerale. I never felt so much confidence wearing other jackets!. Besides the weather protection, I was impressed by the fact that DWR coating showed no signs of wearing off in the hips and the shoulders area. I can not say the same about my many other rain jackets.

Other features I like are the generous hood design and the many pockets. The hood can be optimally adjusted to be worn with a helmet or without it. The two front pockets are good for storing gps, compass, maps, snacks, radio, satellite phone, gloves etc. There are two extra internal pockets. The pit zips for ventilation also come handy for cooling down! This jacket features everything you need on a big day in the countryside. Every single detail is thoughfully designed and well executed. It is a perfect jacket! I never thought I would find one!

This piece was designed to be worn under ""severe conditions"", so it has plenty of room for layering up. When static, I can wear a base layer, a R1 fleece, a Nano Air and a Ghost Whisperer underneath easily and I felt like I could still add more layers! For reference I'm 5,8 ft and I weight 154 pounds (178 cms and 70kg). I wear a SMALL, like in other Arc'teryx garments. If you don't intend to wear so many layers underneath, you can probably size down. I feel like I could use the x-small too, but it just wouldn't provide enough space for layering up.

If you're heading to the most extreme environments on earth, you live in the end of the world or if you simply valorate the best equipment and want THE MOST PROTECTIVE hardshell in the market, this garment will be a welcome addition to your arsenal. It is expensive, but it will last you many years. I wish I had bought this piece before, instead of wasting my money with cheaper jackets. I will definetely buy again rain gear from ARC'TERYX.

This is not a simple rain jacket. It is as a critical survival piece. Just buy it! You will not regret!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-11-07 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

It's fantastic for layering, giving enough room for a decent insulator jacket underneath while still fitting decently close to the body.  No hand pockets but the breast pockets are huge and can hold a ridiculous amount of stuff.

The Magma color is pretty visible from far away through heavy snow, and if you're out skiing with friends it would be pretty hard for them to lose track of you, even though the trees.

I'm a pretty tall guy but I'm pretty thin, so I was kind of stuck between the M and L - tried both of them on and the M fits fine in the arms and down past the waistline, the L is mostly just more voluminous.

I've never had a jacket like this, and I'm so stoked I went for it. The Atom LT is an extremely lightweight, versatile piece for any occasion. I've been wearing it non-stop since the crispy autumn days brought lower temperatures as the summer heatwaves quit. I've seen this jacket wick away a light drizzle with no problem at all. The LT model offers the perfect amount of CoreLoft insulation, keeping me warm when needed. The breathability is insane. I'm just always at the perfect temperature it seems. This thing is magic. 

Based on the construction on this jacket, I knew the fit is meant to be on the shorter side, which I'm not particularly into. Therefore, I went with a medium instead of the small which was recommended from Arc'teryx' sizing chart. The medium on me is just slightly longer than it should be in the arms, but I'm into it.

"Arc'teryx","Atom LT Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","108681443",5,"From the endless glaciers of Mount Rainier, to the massive granite faces of El Capitan, and the rugged ice clad peaks in the high Sierra the Arc'teryx Atom LT is perhaps the best insulating piece I have ever used. Its functionality is very well thought out, and with high versatility, decent durability, and high comfort it is a true workhorse in any environment. This jacket was designed with the intention of moving fast in the mountains, because of this the jacket is lightly insulated and highly breathable, but also surprisingly warm for how thin it feels. For storage, the jacket can be easily packed into its own sleeve.

Insulation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The jacket uses 60 grams of  Coreloft™ insulation. Composed of polyester, this material is durable, lightweight, dries far more quickly than down, and most importantly will still keep the user warm when wet. 

Fabric
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The outer shell of the Atom LT is composed of 20 denier nylon Tyono™ fabric on the majority of the jacket, and a polyester/elastane Polartec® Power Stretch® fabric under the arms and on the sides of the jacket. The Polartec® fabric is extremely breathable, and is quite stretchy. This gives the user better range of motion especially when reaching overhead while climbing. The Tyono™ shell material is DWR treated and is thus highly water resistant. I have walked for miles in light to medium rain in this jacket while remaining completely dry. The same material also makes the jacket exceptionally wind resistant, The interior of the jacket is the same material as the outer with the exception of the underarms which are a soft comfortable fleece. 



Comfort
-------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the greatest reasons that I love this jacket, is that it is incredibly comfortable and remains so indefinitely while moving in the mountains. Because of its superb breathability, the jacket has a massive comfortable temperature range. I have worn it from the mid sixties to the low twenties (Fahrenheit) and remained the same comfortable temperature. The hood is also climbing helmet compatible and works well both under and over a helmet. The jacket is also extremely lightweight for the warmth that it provides, and feels almost weightless as you glide across technical terrain with ease. This jacket makes the perfect mid-layer, and when paired with a good base layer and high end hard shell such as the Arc'teryx Alpha SV (review coming soon). It is perfect for almost any conditions in alpine environments weather hiking, climbing, backpacking, or skiing.



Reliability/Durability
-------------------------------------------------------------------
After 6 months of very heavy use in the mountains, the jacket is still in almost perfect condition/ The outer shell is surprisingly resilient for how thin and light it feels, and provides decent protection against abrasion. The jacket did get a small hole after getting snagged on a section of razor sharp rock while climbing in Wyoming, though this was easily repaired with a tiny Goretex patch. Other than that, one of the jacket's cuffs is starting to show signs of wear as a small hole has appeared where the cuff connects to the shell fabric. As far as reliability, this jacket has never failed me even after hundreds of hours in the mountains and in often heinous conditions; rain, snow, sleet, sand, dirt, nothing can stop this jacket from doing its job. When cared for properly and washed with an appropriate technical clothing detergent (Arc'teryx recommends Grangers, but Nikwax works just fine) the jacket remains in very good condition, and the insulation has not lost any loft whatsoever.

I've now used the Ferrosi for a month that included a 3 week trip to the UK. There I wore the jacket for both in town use and for days of hiking in the Scottish Highlands. Some impressions.

Fit. I'm 6', 200 lb, 44"" chest,  long arms. The size L Ferrosi fits well as long as I don't layer heavily underneath. The cut has a bit less taper than, say, Arc'teryx, where I have to go XL to get a fit. The Ferrosi body length is good (just above my crotch, and the arms are plenty long. Nice.

Features. Two hand warmer pockets and a chest pocket. No interior pockets. Bottom hem drawcord. That's about it. Oh, cuff ends have thumb loops; I thought this would be a useless feature, but the fabric is so soft that they actually work. 

Fabric. The Ferrosi fabric is a single-weave stretchwoven, relatively smooth outside, kind of nubby inside. Softer and lighter than double-weave stretchwovens I've worn. Very comfortable, fast drying, comfortable across a range of temperatures, and about as wind-resistant as heavier soft shells I've worn.

Performance. I wore this with a T-shirt beneath for 60s - 70s (F) days jetting around London - comfortable, didn't overheat. I wore it standing on a rainy train stop in Highland Scotland, and for walking the hills there - good wind resistance, shed rain, dried easily when given a chance. And everything in between.

I have used this jacket from summer to winter now in Colorado's high country to Utah's deserts and have been nothing but amazed.  The Cathode's ability to keep you the right temperature despite varied conditions and activity has amazed me. 

 The jacket preforms excellently for belaying, backpacking, ski touring, hiking, alpine running, and resort riding. Where the cathode really shines is keeping you warm, but not too warm, when you're moving. 

 It accomplishes this by combining the Pertex 20D where the insulation is and softshell under the arm and side of torso. What this does it keep the warmth in the baffles and not let it escape. The fabric repels wind and light moisture very well, though it means it does not breath well, but that's where the softshell shines. You are able to release extra heat and stay in the right zone. I find myself leaving this layer on much longer than any other layer I have. 

The Prima loft Gold is super light, warm, and continues to keep you warm even if you get the fabric wet. Which can happen from sweating or perception, so it makes this jacket much safer and more comfortable. 

It works well as your outer layer when skinning or hiking, or underneath a shell when the wind is ripping or its colder out. I am careful with the fabric, but it has stood up fine to light bush-wacking and rubbing up against rocks . The hood is very well designed and seals around your head well. It doesn't fit well over a helmet, but sits underneath nicely. It stuffs into it's own pocket nicely, and can compresses more once its in your pack.

The outer fabric has been very durable so far too, and one thing I love is that I can shred or bushwhack through our twiggy EC glades without worrying about tears (like I do with my down layer).

When the wind picks up you definitely need a shell on top; cold wind rips right through the side and underarm fabric. It's not really a downside to me, since that why you bring a wind layer in the first place. I still notice the great breathability when it's under the shell, and it's a great layer paired with a microfleece and shell on cold days.

The hood is great; keeps the warm air in nicely and fits well under a helmet.

Full disclosure: I also own a Patagonia Dimensions Jacketââmy go to softshell for skiing and climbing when the weather is really inclement. 

The Levitation Hoody, by contrast, is a water and wind resistant hoody that won't protect you quite as well as a heavier softshell, but is supremely breathable, comfortable, and, most importantlyââLIGHT. 

Pros: 

Extremely lightweightââyou forget you are wearing it, or carrying it in your pack. I really look forward to using this in a Colorado summer while hiking and backpacking 14ers.

 Articulated athletic fitââtrue to size in every way. Sleeves are just the right length, and the taper is perfect for slender, well muscled climbers and skiers. You can be confident ordering the right size for you.

Very comfortable for skiing on days where temps are 20+ degrees.

Repels rainââI had to take a flight to the midwest (yuck) a month ago and didn't have a dedicated rain jacketââthis hoody held up admirably and dried out quickly!

Not really anything. The jacket could conceivably be more versatile in terms of handling cold and intense wind, but then it would sacrifice some of the qualities that it excels in.

"Patagonia","Down Sweater Jacket - Men's","107901349",5,"I was on the fence about this jacket. I really did not like how flimsy and thin the ultralight version was but I wanted a great down jacket that was also as light as possible. I was torn between this one and another jacket by another brand that was about 4 ounces lighter. I opted to buy both for maximum flexibility and choice. I realize this is not always an option (and the first time I have done this myself), but I could have stuck with the Down Sweater, to be honest.

I sweat, I do not perspire. With that means that I cannot wear down jackets when I am working hard and sweating (even with down treatment). For me, the down jacket is for cold nights at camp after I have cooled down and am not swimming in my sweat.

I have already taken this jacket out a couple of times and I love the weight and packability. I purchased a 3L dry sack (because I live in the PNW) and found that in the dry sack this jacket packs down smaller than in its own pocket stuff sack. The jacket sat beautifully in the bottom of my pack without taking much space until lunch time when, after a full morning of rigorous snowshoeing, I needed to let my mid layer dry off a bit. I was warm within minutes in this jacket, fresh out of the stuff sack. The jacket puffed up quickly and I was actually overheating and had to vent the jacket after 10 minutes.

This jacket is also much more rugged than the ultralight version. This may not be as much of a deal for some as it is for me but I want a jacket that can withstand me and my less than graceful ways and accidents. I also tend to push my gear hard.  I have also worn it out around town a couple of times and it blocks the wind enough to keep me warm but also lets enough in that I am not cooking inside (which happens a lot). Please keep in mind that I run warmer than most.

If I had a complaint (which is not enough to effect my rating of the jacket), it would be that the cut is a little on the generous side. I wear a large in most brands unless they run small and usually, with a couple layers on, a large will fit over everything with little room to spare. I am not super slender or overly muscular but I also do not have a midsection either. This jacket is almost too generously cut for my liking. There is no question that you can layer plenty underneath this jacket and it will still feel comfortable. With a t-shirt or a couple light layers, this jacket is very roomy. This could be good for some but maybe not for others. I rated the jacket as true to size but some may consider the jacket to run large.

Needless to say that this jacket, despite the extra 4 ounces, is worth it to me over the ultralight version. It looks good both around town and keeps you warm in the backcountry. A great all around jacket. And Patagonia's views on the environment make it one of the few companies that I purchase gear from.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-04-27 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

That's awful as the sleeve just drops out over my hand constantly.   It can make using your hands INTENSELY annoying.   Since I was about to check out with the regular version and saw on the bottom of the screen the ""hooded"" version; I assumed the hooded was the same as the regular; only with a hood added. Silly me.   2) the pockets have a vented liner in them.  This is almost the same as leaving bare hands out in the cold if it's truly cold & windy outside (when else would I use the wind Stopper?  I'm all ears)  because the material sags with the weight of your hands.  I'd like to see a cold weather jacket pocket lined by the coats material - not cheaper vent with large holes.  Even the material used on the Denali pockets would be better.  Also, keys get caught in it.  3)The chest on the large is great for me(43) but the arms are for a gorilla (they're long).

Can tell right away that it blocks wind in blowing weather. Does fine in light rain as water beads, but I think it would leak through an extended and hard rain.  Not meant to  be waterproof, so might need hard shell over. Also, seems good down to about 25-30 degrees depending on base layers.  Surprisingly warm for weight.

Good for active use with ""stretchy"" material. Relaxed fit allows for layering.  Only down side is the cut of the  sleeves.  They are cut very tight and I have a difficult time getting the jacket on with anything but short sleeves or a thin base layer. The fleece in the sleeves seems to grab whatever you have on your arms since they are so tight. Only reason I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5. Have asked another owner when I saw him wearing in a store and he said he has the same problem. He also loved jacket otherwise. So, difficult to layer over anything bulky in the sleeves.  Bought the hooded version as keeps my head and neck dry and warm with cold or rain. Easy to flip up, but wish it stowed to keep out of the way. It does not. Cinching the hood allows close fit with my head and face and does a good job turning with my head. So, does well in allowing unobstructed view, pet peeve of mine with other jackets. 

Side pockets have meshy material inside so opening pockets allows for venting when getting warm. No pit zips. The upper chest pocket has small hole that allows you to snake your head phones cable inside your jacket from the IPod or MP3 player in that pocket up to your ears. . Guide loop inside.

Bought the hoodless version for my daughters and liked the style and quality so bought the hooded one for me. Thought the hood was definitely worth the extra $20 at regular price.

A bit pricey at MSRP of $170 but caught on sale for $110 so was a snag. Suspect I will love for long while to come. Cheers.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-03-14 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

This allowed me to put my hand inside to get warm without letting warm air leak out. They had no zippers. The Greenland has vertical zippered pockets which allow lots of heat to escape when using them to warm your hands. Marmot is degrading in recent years.

2. Lofts incredibly. Fills all available air space, but completely unrestrictive.
 
3. Compresses well. The light shell and super high quality down crush down.
 
4. Great design. The belay zip works, and the flash pocket is key. The hood is perfect.

A medium shirt (most often bought by me) has the potential to fit perfect throughout the torso and be too tight in the shoulders (insert the joke about wearing little brothers shirt). A large usually fits perfect in the shoulders but is too baggy and/or long in the torso. Having said all of that I gambled and purchased a medium despite the fact that it has an athletic fit. It is a tad snug in the shoulders but fits great otherwise. I tried on a large while in CO and made the right choice with the medium. If I layered more clothing underneath the jacket a medium would be too tight. Hope this helps!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-09-29 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

I'm 6' tall, 166 pounds and a fairly lean athletic build. My chest is 37.5"", my wast is 32"" and my arm length shoulder to wristbone is 25"". 

I bought the coat to layer on top of, and maybe a thin layer under.
I originally purchased a large. For me, it was just too baggy. When I pulled out the chest it stuck out over a foot. When wearing it zipped up, it bulged out in the front. I wanted something slim that won't get in the way, so I exchanged it for a medium. Thanks to Backcountry.com, the exchange was easy and quick!

So I got the medium and tried it on, overall it fits just right, almost. When I move my arms forward, it binds around the upper back the way a too small garmet will. The cuff is just about perfect if not a touch short. When I reach overhead, there's no binding, but If it was tucked in to say, a harness, you would feel it bind. 

So, I'm going to keep it as I don't want to go back to the baggy large. But I'm just a bit dissapointed in Ooutdoor Research. You'd think that with their experience they'd have these things diled in. and the size chart would put me right int he medium zone. Oh well. Other than those things, it seems perfect. It compresses in to it's own pocket to a ""semi-small"" size. It has a clip loop and I could see climbing with it clipped to my harness, but it's on the larger end for that purpose.

My old rain shell bit the dust after a few years of heavy use, so I decided I wanted to upgrade a little. I needed something to check these boxes:
1. Trim enough to fit a button-down or light fleece and not much else.
2. Packable enough that I won't think twice about bringing it when I travel.
3. Durable enough not to get trashed by backpack straps.
4. Breathable enough that I won't feel like I'm in a sauna when bike commuting.

After searching around and getting a recommendation from Leta, I decided on the Axiom. It's trim enough to look good with just a t-shirt, but has enough room for my Atom LT if needed. It's packable enough to fit in a medium Eagle Creek cube with a base layer or my wife's rain coat without having to force it. I've used it 6 times and the durability seems to be fine. Based on the other reviews, I have nothing to worry about there. Breathability is activity dependent as always, but this jacket surprised me. I can wear it up to 50 while biking before I start sweating like crazy and actually felt chilly standing around at 60 when the wind was blowing, which is very similar to my running jacket which isn't waterproof and has lots of ventilation holes. 

I know it would add some weight, but I'd still like to see pit zips for when I'm super active (bike commuting). The hem isn't tight enough for me to return it, but a little more room would be nice. 

My biggest regret is that when I stopped to help someone change a flat, I casually laid my jacket on my bike, and got some grease on the hood. Totally goofed on that one..

Since I'm sure you'll read this Leta, how would you compare this to the Realm? I didn't know about it until I already bought this and put some grease on it.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-15 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

The unsettled weather and rapidly changing conditions meant that I was usually wearing a hard shell, even while approaching and climbing.  During periods of heavy movement, I would wear the OR Ferosi, but then layer up with this on the outside when things got real.  It saved my bacon and turned out to be extremely durable. 
Durability: 
I climbed plenty of technical mixed and ice pitches that put holes in my pack, pants, and other layers, but this thing looks brand new.  I like the larger than normal zipper teeth, which seem more robust than some of those on other jackets. 
Fit:
I went with a large as I usually wear the jacket as my outer-most layer, sometimes even over a midweight down-layer while burning time in cold, snowy conditions.  This fits well for me in the those cases, but I also have broad shoulders. When wearing only over a t-shirt or something, the fit is a tad big. Fits nicely over my helmet without restricting movement and the sleeve length is good for swinging tools.

If itâs a fine misty rain for a short duration it will be fine but anything heavier and you will get wet. Similar with the wind too, itâs good for keeping out the light breeze but if the wind steps up you will feel it. For me though this jacket is a great compromise between breathable, windproof and water proof. I find the fit a tad on the large side but that gives me layering options and with its flexibility it makes for a comfortable and functional jacket. Glad I made the purchase.

I was put in that situation while on a rafting trip recently, and had to leave the comfort of the raft for a kayak, to relieve a frozen elder on our trip. I swam a few rapids, an unpleasant experience when you didn't sign up for it, but this jacket performed sooooo well when I wasn't in a capsized kayak or in the drink. Water beaded up on the outside, even when it was saturated. It dried up quick when I back on land and kept the wind chill down.

"Outdoor Research","Ferrosi Hooded Jacket - Men's","110199637",5,"I got the Ferrosi this fall with the intention of using it as a ski touring layer, but am very impressed so far with its performance as a cool weather cycling layer. I wore it over a base layer and under a raincoat on a chilly 35 degree morning, and by the time I got to the top of the first climb (a seven mile climb) I was very surprised that I wasn't feeling too sweaty. I unziped the raincoat on the top to find that the base layer and ferrosi had transported all of my moisture away from my body until it was stopped by the raincoat. The outside of the ferrosi was getting wet, but the inside was wicking unbelievably well. I have never had a jacket like this that was able to move moisture like that. The downfall of the ferrosi is wind resistance. For fast, chilly descents on my bike the ferrosi did not offer as much protection from wind as some other jackets I have used. This is not a downfall, more of a trade-off between breathability and weather resistance. This thing breathes like a baselayer and sheds a light rain and breeze well.  For skiing I expect it will be perfect because I move much slower in the skin track than on my bike, and on the way down I will be putting on an insulating layer underneath or a shell over top. So on the spectrum of breathability and weather protection, this jacket falls squarely on the breathable side, which for me is perfect as I intend to use it for high output activities. The other beautiful thing about this jacket is how small it packs down, not that you'll ever need to put it i your pack.

Very wind and weather resistant. Mild snow and spindrift is of no concern during touring or mountaineering. It's abrasion resistant so you can climb in it, no worries. 

The Ferrosi breaths like a champ, making it equally happy during high exertion winter activities with a light fleece, and as fall/spring standalone active piece. 

Packs down small into it's own pocket with a harness clip, and weighs basically nothing. Very stretchy, low profile, good fit and cut so you can layer a fleece under, or easily throw a puffy over if you need to warm up.

DWR can take a beating without wetting out in Utah snow, but PNW heavy rain will devour you in under 10 minutes.

Biggest flaws are the hood, which needs more volume for a helmet, and hand pockets are low for access while wearing a pack.

I had to grab one. That is when my love for all things Outdoor Research occurred.

The Ferrosi jacket is by far the best all around lightweight jacket in existence. The feel is comfortable. It carries great warmth for its weight. I wore it while bearing a very windy low to mid 20s MN day in early march waiting outside for an event for over 90 mins. While i was cold  i was not freezing. That was sitting in one spot. I know moving around had I been hiking would have kept me nice and toasty. So sitting immobile for such a period of time in those temperatures with no gloves really spoke volumes to me.

The wind will break through somewhat but not once do you get a shivering chill. There is a nice coolness factor when you turn it up and go hard while wearing it that really is great at regulating body heat.

It also offers great water resistance. Rain beads off nicely and has a great fitted hood that fits your head without adjusting.

It packs down nice and small so its a backpacking dream.

For aesthetics, they offer a lot of two tone and solid colours for people. I got the mushroom and brown jacket and love it. It has built in thumb loops on the new 2017 model so it makes slipping it through a thicker jacket a breeze. The fit is nice and gives room for layering while maintaing a great athletic cut.

The 800-fill goose down traps body heat very well, and I found myself comfortable in temperatures down to the low teens. It also packs down small so it fits nice and compact in your pack.

While it does have a DWR coating that works reasonably well, you'll definitely want a shell over it if the heavens do open up...it is still down after all, and wasn't really designed with heavy duty waterproofness in mind. As an insulating mid layer or outer layer on clear cold days, however, you can't go wrong.

The fit is near perfect, at least for me. The cut is such that you can wear a thin baselayer underneath and still wear your shell over it. I also like that the logo isn't large or in-your-face...kind of a pet peeve of mine. (Don't get me wrong, I don't mind logos on gear, I just prefer them to be subdued and not screaming at you.)

I'll admit, I was a little hesitant to spend the money on something that says Patagonia on it, but I'm glad I did. The Ultralight Down Jacket has become one of my favorite cold-weather pieces for my outdoor adventures, and should last a good long time. I highly recommend it!

"Arc'teryx","Gamma MX Softshell Jacket - Men's","3820935",5,"I'll review both the Gamma MX and the Epsilon LT, which I considered and ordered, and why I kept the Gamma.

I was looking for basically a more fleece-like jacket, with the added benefit of some wind resistance and a smooth face fabric to resist stains and pilling.  Use for bike commuting in dry, cold weather, and as a casual piece during the fall/winter.

I initially considered the Gamma MX, Epsilon LT, and the Gamma LT, all of which seem somewhat similar.  I eliminated the Gamma LT as it seemed closer to a shell from what I could tell, and lacked a nice inner fleece fabric, which is a must, as I plan to wear it over just a t-shirt and want a nice fabric on my skin.  Aesthetically, I didn't like the Arc'teryx logo on the back of the Gamma LT neck either.

So I ordered the Epsilon LT and the Gamma MX.  My impressions:

Fit:  Fit is about the same, the Epsilon seems just a tad longer and slimmer, while the Gamma MX is a bit boxier it feels.  Perhaps this is because the fabric on the Epsilon is quite a bit stiffer.  Overall, size M for me, 5' 10, 160lbs, was just about perfect, and consistent with Arcteryx sizing.  

Fabric: Both are so good, but different.  The Epsilon is classified in some places as a ""hard-fleece"" which I figured would be more fleece-like than a softshell, assuming the continuum from fleece to shell goes from soft to hard, comfortable to stiff.  Not so.  The Epsilon is quite a bit more rigid, and doesn't fold and flex like the Gamma MX.  It's not bad, it's just not what I wanted.  If you're looking for a more handsome jacket to maybe wear business casual, the Epsilon definitely looks better because of that rigidity, and it feels tough as nails, it's really a cool fabric.  On the other hand, the Gamma MX is very soft, supple, and lightweight, and I like the way it moves with me much more.  It's a lot more comfortable, but feels a little less robust.

Features:  Both are great.  I'm not a fan of the contrasting color of the bicep pocket on either jacket.  Zippers are nice, pockets are large on both.  The chest pockets on the Gamma look nice and are roomy, but I don't plan on using them for much.  There's a really nice storm-flap on the Gamma, coated in some sort of rubberized plastic, and it's nice.  The zipper is nicer on the Gamma.  And the SLEEVE CUFFS.  This, in the end, was the make or break feature for me.  The Epsilon LT cuffs are really annoying.  They're too big, so you get the sleeves coming down over your hands all the time.  Maybe that's nice if you're wearing a base layer or a shirt with cuffs on it, but the Gamma MX cuffs are perfect size, and keep the sleeves from coming too far down.  While wearing the Epsilon, I found myself constantly annoyed with the cuffs in my way.  The Gamma cuffs are perfect, I never think about them at all.

I can't comment too much on performance comparisons, because I didn't test the Epsilon before returning.  However, the Gamma is great as far as breathability and windproofness.  It feels lighter than you'd expect, but in 45 degrees, riding 30mph on a bike, it blocked 90+ % of the wind coming through, and didn't get all clammy.  That's much better than any other softshell I've ever used, including Polartec PowerShield and a Marmot ROM.  It's expensive, but it works well.

In the end, both jackets are fantastic, and I would expect the Epsilon to perform similarly to the Gamma MX as far as breathability and windproofness.  But the cuffs on the Gamma MX are what sealed the deal for me, as petty as that sounds.  Maybe that should give some insight as to how similar these jackets feel in form and function.

Since then I've used it for just about any activity from skiing to climbing. One thing I love is how durable it is. I was in a cave a little over a foot white and was sliding through it wearing this jacket. I thought it would surely show signs of the scraping in the cave but nope, it withstood all the abrasion with no problem. Another thing I love is just how versatile it is, it can be worn as a stand alone piece in moderately cool weather, it can be a layering piece, and it also has enough room for more layers underneath. When spring skiing i wear this and another layer underneath and am completely warm. It is advertised as water resistant which it is, but it really takes alot for it to give, and it is also fully windproof. 

Pros: Versatile, Comfortable, Great weatherproofing, light/packable, stylish, decently warm.
Cons: Requires more layering for colder weather, price

Overall this jacket is great, it is a great piece for just about anyone wanting a daily use jacket that can still hand up to just about anything thrown at it. Must buy!

"Arc'teryx","Gamma MX Softshell Jacket - Men's","1207255",4,"I bought this to replace my 2nd Gamma MX since I got a screaming deal.  I am sold on the concept of this jacket and use it as a light shoulder season jacket on it's own and a layering  or high exertion piece in the winter.  I rarely use sweaters, fleeces anymore since buying the MX.  Between a short sleeve or long sleeve base layer, the MX, and a shell in various combinations I'm set for 85%+ of the conditions in CO.  I swap out the MX for an insulating layer only when it really gets really cold.

That said - I don't like the new Fortius material nearly as much as the old.  The face isn't as slippery (read harder to use for layering) and it feels warmer, but not in a good way.  Where it used to be a perfect for 35-60F depending on level of activity, it now feels too warm at the higher half even as a casual piece.

I also don't like that they relaxed the fit of the XL.  Now too roomy in the arms and gut even for a big guy.  It is much less athletic.  I'm a big fan of Arc for not assuming that all XL guys are fat arses like NF does, but they headed in that direction in this version of the Gamma MX.

Seriously If you wear a large go medium. I would say in most cases go down a size for this jacket. 

To start off this jacket is pretty awesome. Feels big and heavy enough to stand up for all cold. The snowskirt definitely adds a warmth factor by trapping the heat.

The hood feels great and well insulated keeping my head perfectly warm. Mesh Inside pocket is huge which will be great for goggles when skiing. 

Cons: the outside pockets--
Their big and the zipper starts at the top so to comfortably use them as hand pockets they will be open and leaving gaps for blowing snow/sleet. I dont know why they didnt just have the zippers start from the bottom.....

"Arc'teryx","Atom SL Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","106312630",5,"I spent about two weeks deliberating what lightly insulated jacket I should get for my husband for Christmas. I waffled between jackets for what felt like forever, but I always kept coming back to this one. So, this is what he ended up with and since there's powder to be had, I figured he should end up with the jacket early. This is his feedback:

""I'm a pretty small person but I run warm on the skin track, and until I figured that out about myself and my physiology I was having a helluva time trying to figure out my layering system.

Last season, on the coldest days I was trying to wear my Atom LT-- and it was nice from the car for about the first 4 minutes and then I was sweating bullets. Eventually I just realized that it's best to start cold and wear gloves because my core would warm up pretty quickly. Then the Nano Air came out and I thought that was the solution to my problem but it wasn't (still too much insulation for touring-- at least on the ascent). Then I fell in love with wearing a vest of equivalent insulation because I wouldn't have to take it off at any point in the day. However, then my arms were totally exposed to the elements and I'd often end up with numb arms, which is less than pleasant.

But....after much debate over lightly insulated mid layers my wife and I landed on the Atom SL because there's almost no insulation anywhere other than the front and back torso. The arms feature a mesh-lining that wicks away moisture, making it ideal for aerobic activities. And the side panels run from the length of your wrist to the hem and they consists of a stretchy breathable material that allows your pits to dump excess heat. Meanwhile, the exterior fabric is definitely mobility oriented, and sheds water and wind really well.

So far this season it's still been a little warm for me to wear this layer the whole day, but it also packs down small enough to not be a burden, making it great for on-the-fly protection and warmth. I intend to use this layer as my cold weather mid layer, paired with a thin long sleeve merino baselayer. Honestly, I don't think this layer could be beat-- especially in wet/windy areas like New England or the PNW. 

Bottom line: if you're familiar with the nuances of layering and full on midweight jackets were always a little bit much for you, give this layer a whirl. And to boot, I know it's going to be a major asset to my summer camping/hiking setup as well as my cold weather running layers.

As far as sizing goes-- if you're somewhere between sizes, don't hesitate to size up. I'm a small in most things, but I got the medium, because I remember Arc'teryx jackets traditionally being pretty short in the torso. The medium works totally fine but the small would have worked really well too-- it's not as short as I thought it was going to be. Either way, I'm happy.

And least importantly, but worth mentioning-- I'm pretty pale and super blonde, so yellow colorways rarely look good on me. However, the Bourbon looks awesome when I wear it casually and doesn't make me look like a washed out and washed up goober- so, so far this thing has yet to let me down and yet to be taken off.""","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-16 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Arc'teryx","Atom SL Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","2048086160",5,"This jacket is a great addition to the Atom family, and really rounds the group out. My favorite insulating layer has been the Atom LT for some time now, due to its comfort and versatility. The Atom AR is also great, but I have given the LT the edge, because it is more capable of being used as an active piece, thanks to the fleece underarm panelling that dumps excess heat really effectively. The SL takes the active capabilities of the LT and extends them significantly. Granted, you do lose a little of the versatility to be had with the LT, as I would not recommend using the SL as an all-around cool weather jacket. However, if you are looking for a lightweight insulating layer for cold weather activities, the Atom SL fits the bill perfectly. 

As for fit, I consider it true to size, but it is important to mind the fact that this is a trim cut. It is intended to be used for active use, so it is not really a casual-wear type of cut. If you tend to straddle two sizes, it might be best to go with the upper end. 

In sum, if you are looking for a warm jacket for all-around casual use in the winter, this is not it - you want the AR. If you want a jacket that is an ultimate generalist, that can do the above, as well as a bit of active use, then the Atom LT is probably what you want.

Lately it's been one of my go-to jackets for ski touring.  The torso has the perfect amount of insulation.  The sleeves are not insulated but feature an excellent moisture wicking mesh.  I've also enjoyed the non-insulated hood.  It offers protection from the wind but breathes well enough that I don't overheat when hiking with the hood deployed.

The No Slip Zip helps mitigate zipper creep, but I'm still able to open the zipper easily with one hand.

It's based on the Trim fit block, same as the Atom LT.  The trim fit block works well if you're going to use this as a mid layer and need to wear a hard shell.

"The North Face","Canyonlands 1/2-Zip Pullover Fleece Jacket - Men's","107803439",4,"FIT:
The Canyonlands fleece pullover has a nice, tapered, athletic cut so expect the jacket to fit more on the snug side. That being said, this garment is not skin tight so you can easily throw it over a base-layer and be comfortable. The only downside is that I keep finding myself trying to slip my hands into pockets that don't exist.

QUALITY:
As with most TFN products, the quality of the fleece is outstanding. Keep in mind this is a very light-weight jacket so it feels a little thin. Don't let that fool you as this mid-layer will keep you plenty warm in cool conditions. However, if you're anticipating extreme weather, you will probably want something warmer.

USE:
I use this jacket over my base-layer while hiking. It's very lightweight and easily stowable in your pack. The extended zipper allows for extra breathability and the chest pocket is convenient for storing small items.

CONCLUSION:
This fleece is very comfortable and I love the tapered fit. I would recommend this to any customer who is in the market for a lightweight mid-layer that won't get too toasty.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-05-21 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

I'm 5.9"", 185. I am sometimes between a medium and a large although most of my jackets are large.

Firstly, the fit for this jacket is listed as trim but I found the large to be very large on me. I think a medium might have worked better although I'll keep the large so that I can layer more underneath. This is not a thick puffy. Others say this runs small so clearly your mileage may vary, but I have a couple of OR base layer shirts and those too run really large. I've found their button-down shirts to be the same.

Secondly, the fabric is Pertex Shield+. I suspected that would mean a very shiny jacket and it is. I got mine in Hydro/Abyss (blue) and from many pictures you see online it doesn't look shiny at all. I'm OK with it, just FYI.

Thirdly, the Pertex fabric is a little ""crinkly"". Not as loud as some Gore-Tex jackets but definitely not silent like a Patagonia Down Sweater. It's not a big deal.

The key feature of this jacket is that it's waterproof (as the industry calls it) by having the Pertex Shield fabric and NOT puncturing it. There are no stitches through the fabric for the baffles.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-01-25 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

I first wore Floodlight with a short sleeve shirt under it on a windy +30F day, and it wasn't enough.  What I learned was this is a great jacket for layering. With a fleece sweater under it, it's warm down to nearly zero if there isn't a lot of wind.  I haven't had a chance to test waterproofness, but it looks like it will be OK in freezing rain but maybe not a down pour.  The zipper is pretty exposed. The hood is very nice, and the large pockets are outstanding.  It's a slim cut and fits a bit tight.

The hood fits nice, not quite under a ski helmet but good for a transition and on the uphill. Thumb loops are better than some older OR piece I've had.  I got this piece as a replacement for an OR Acetylene jacket (my favorite midlayers ever!) and I'm a little disappoint in the warmth of the Deviator compared to it. Much more breathable and more like a baselayer with insulation in the front. 
Now some folks might prefer this piece for its warmer weather versitility but I'm left wanting more.
Pros: Fit is awesome with great mobility. Chest pocket is big enough for a smart phone. Body mapping is down very nicely. The Polartec fabric is soft and breathable.
Cons: Thinner fabric than I'd like. No zippers on the hand pockets so they're only good for warming hands. Also would prefer no hood to prevent ""hood stacking. Because of its thin, close fitting nature its prone to odor after a few tours. 
All in all, this is a well built jacket with quality materials. It can be used for cycling, climbing, skiing and running. I'm just missing the Acetylene.

I even contacted a Backcountry rep through chat and they were fairly useless as they didn't have personal experience and almost lead me to pick the wrong size.

I'm 6'0 male.  Roughly 180-185lbs.  Chest around 41-42"".  33"" waist.

I'm right in between Med and Large for most tops and it really depends on the cut.  I ended up getting a Large and am pretty sure that's the way to go.  Rep tried to tell me to get an XL and that would have been way too baggy.  I probably could have pulled off a medium but I think that would have been really tight in the chest area.

The ""slim"" fit of this feels like it's mostly in the chest.  The lower half of this is sort of billowy/baggy.  Yes, there's a drawstring to cinch it but I don't find that necessary.  My L is pretty form-fitting but still has some space around the stomach area....not a ton that it would blow in the breeze or look bad.  I'm just saying it's not AS slim as in the upper body.  Frankly, it looks and feels fine.  A Medium would likely have been very very form fitting.  A Large is snug but has enough room to wear something thin underneath it.  Point is, if you are in between sizes, you'd probably do well to pick the larger size.  If you are right on the money w/their sizing chart, and you don't have a huge gut, pick your normal size and remember that it's supposed to be a slim, active fit.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-16 00:00:00","I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions",""

"Outdoor Research","Deviator Hooded Insulated Jacket - Men's","106636693",4,"I bought this ""mid-layer"" to keep me warm underneath bigger, puffier layers, or as a layer for running/climbing in colder weather. It's surprisingly warm for how thin it is and seems to be very efficient at keeping accumulated sweat buildup at bay. I do think the material could be ever so slightly thicker on the sleeves to match the insulation over the core.

 My main issue is with how thin the outermost material is. Though  very windproof and warm for its weight, I managed to make two small tears in the fabric after using the hoody outside only a few times. Outdoor Research offered to honor their lifetime warranty and send me a new one, which was helpful, but if your main applications involve bushwhacking, chimney-ing, or otherwise thrashing your gear you might want to look elsewhere.

If you're looking for a warm, lightweight mid-layer for any sort of active application that has you sweating and doesn't normally tear through your clothing, this is a good choice.

EDIT: After using this piece for almost a full year I'm looking in to buying my second (and possibly third). Though the face material is a bit fragile the insulation tends to hold up well in the wash so my small tears have not rendered the layer useless.

This jacket is PERFECT for long, cold approaches so as to keep me from being sweaty and gross and cold when I arrive at the cliff (or boulder, I generally use it for climbing). I couldn't find my cycling base layers one cold morning and used the Deviator instead and was floored by how well it worked. Perfect insulation, breathability, and some windstopper up front. Though Leta has said this is not intended as a base layer it is what I use it primarily for, and I love it.

Other outdoor clothing companies need to take note and make something in this same category. For now, OR has the market cornered. Leta's response should be a good indication of how well this company will take care of you. They are honest and generally quick to respond...the lifetime warranty helps me sleep at night but seems as if it's something I will rarely/if ever have to worry about.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-12-06 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

The Gore-Tex C-knit fabric feels much better against bare skin compared to the Gore-Tex Pro material, so this jacket can be worn with minimal baselayers in warm-but-windy situations. 

The breathability is exactly what you would expect from a Gore-Tex product! 

The fit runs a bit large; I typically wear a large, but sized down to a medium. The sleeves are still a little long, but everything else is great. 

The coat does have a small strap to attach it to Patagonia snow pants and bibs, however, it does lack a powder skirt for those deepest days! 

I expect that I'll buy another one of these when I finally do wear this coat out!



Season update: 

I have found the medium fit to run a little tight when wearing a beacon in addition to a puffy vest. 

The hood design is actually pretty poor- The single draw string pulls the hood back. You can see, but the sides of your face are exposed to wind and moisture. 

The coat exterior proves to be durable. Lots of tours and sidecountry on this one- no rubbing wear from pack shoulder straps or waist buckles. 

However, the c-knit material inside the coat seems to be less durable. There is obvious wear where the pack is pressed against my back by the backpack. It seems like the Goretex Pro material is more durable.

The one design flaw is the lack of a powder skirt, which is unfortunate. I hope next year they fix this, or add in more jackets with the C-knit construction.

The color scheme is nice too.

Size-wise: I like that it's not overly baggy. I tend to wear a Large in the Regulator Fleeces but usually have to downsize to a Medium in Patagonia shells. The same trend continues with this (Medium). I do like that it's not quite as baggy as the PowSlayer or Powderbowl.

The helmet compatible hood works for a bike helmet.

Fit: This coat is designed with climbing in mind and has a slim fit, the medium is definitely a close fit on me, and a large would have done just as well.

This raincoat is a must have for ultralight backcountry pursuits.

On its first and only outing you can feel the extra fabric compared to the regular Houdini. Means it doesnt breathe as well but, protects much better. Right now in the Wasatch, the upper elevations are around 60 degrees, makes the normal Houdini the perfect option should you need a light shell. I had it in the Teton's where it was more like 40 degrees at the summits and it wasnt enough, this is where the Alpine Fits in my quiver of shells. Below 40 degrees and the verdict is still out on how far I can push it in the cold .

The first thing to notice is the difference in fit. Where the normal Houdini is a tighter, trimmer fit, the Alpine Houdini has extra room for layering. I own the Large in the normal Houdini and sized down to the Medium in the Alpine Houdini. I wouldnt say it runs Large, it fits like my large Westcomb ski jacket. That still has too much fabric to alpine rock climb for me. With the medium Alpine Houdini I still can layer with my go-to cold weather choice, which is: Capilene 1, R1 Hoody, Nano-Air Hoody, and then the Alpine Houdini. 

You can really tell the difference in fabric compared to the normal Houdini. The Alpine Houdini is stiffer, thicker, and much less air-permeable. When trying to stuff it into its own pocket it was creating air pockets, never saw that in the normal Houdini.

I spent tons of time reading reviews before dropping some serious coinage on a shell.  I'm 5'9 175 lbs, athletic build, 33"" sleeve, 40"" chest, and I'm somewhere in between a large and a medium in everything.

I figured large was the way to go for layering, but I was afraid I'd be swimming in the Theta, so I opted for the Beta in large instead.  Whoops.  Don't get me wrong... the Beta is a beautiful shell, but I had wayyy to much room in the chest/shoulders while the length was definitely too short for skiing.  I promptly returned it and purchased a  Theta in medium. YES!

I'm amping to get this thing outdoors.  The fit of the Theta is perfect!  It's not too baggie without layers, but I can comfortably fit a base layer and Atom AR under it.  I can squeeze a  fleece under the Atom AR if necessary, but things start getting a little cramped at that point.  I love the sleeve pocket, and the pocket placement will accommodate a pack nicely.  The length is spot on, but not too long to stop me from using this while climbing/hiking.

Maybe I'll report back in a couple months about how the Theta holds up, but from everything I've read, this thing's bombproof.

I deliberately took this coat out on an hour long heavy rain hike and was perfectly dry. The hood is so good it almost feels like a helmet without the pinch. All of the shock cord adjustments work perfectly and are attached to the jacket so you don't have a big line of shock cord hanging off the coat if it is cinched down. The only down side is the inside pocket doesn't have a zipper but it will hold a hat and gloves. The last thing I noticed is that even with the coat completely unzipped down the front, the coat is tailored so it stays close to the body, which means it doesn't get caught up in brush . I am looking forward to years of being able to stay outside in bad weather and actually enjoy it. Regarding size, I am 5'7"" but have a really broad shoulder. I have to wear large shirts.

I've used the jacket a handful of times for other things in the meantime and love it so far.  I'm 5'9"" and 132, and a Small fits me great - close to the body but not restrictive at all.  (I wear slim fit and sometimes tailored slim fit dress shirts, and while I abhor the word ""skinny,"" it's what I've been called my whole life.)  It has these stretchy side panels all the way through the underarms, so it allows total freedom of movement.  I can even wear a base layer AND a thin microfleece jacket under the LT comfortably.

(I rated it as running small only because I'm so used to even Smalls being slightly too big for me in sports gear, and I've certainly never owned a jacket that fit so close to the body.)

Yesterday I wanted to field test what I am going to wear skiing at Big Sky this spring, so I had on a SmartWool base layer, the LT, and an unlined Gore-Tex shell to shovel during Snowzilla DC 2016.  I was perfectly warm under grey skies, light snow, and 27 degrees.  I didn't feel like I was sweating, but since I shoveled heavy, wet snow for two hours and was breathing hard, I probably would have realized I was, if I'd thought about it.  And when I went back inside, the LT was heavy with dampness - so I guess it really does wick away moisture and keep me comfortable!  I never thought about feeling wet or hot.  I don't know how fast it dried, though I'd wanted to note that, because I hung it up in the guest bath and forgot about it.

Today at 1:00 pm, I wore a cotton t-shirt, a microfleece, and the LT, and just shoveling for 30 seconds under sunny skies and 33 degrees, I was hot and immediately took off the LT.  After shoveling, I put it back on, and it was perfect for taking a leisurely walk at about 2:30 pm.  

It is extremely light, and that makes its performance all the more impressive, as well as making it a pleasure to wear.

I've worn it in town when it's been maybe 50 or so, and it's too cold if there's wind, since its breathability also means the wind goes right through.

It doesn't have a bag, but it packs into one of its own sleeves.  And you can do this cool parlor trick where with one yank of the wrist, the whole jacket reappears (you'll want to demo this for your friends) - but I have to say, when it comes out, it's completely wrinkled.  (Eventually the wrinkles work themselves out, but it looks pretty bad until then!  Next time I might try just folding it into fourths and flattening it in a Space Bag.)

It has this cool flap at the very top of the zipper so that the zipper doesn't come into contact with your neck if you zip it all the way to the very top.  And the wrists are snug (not tight like elastic), which is great since you may be putting on another layer... but it's easy to put your hand through the end because it's stretchy, like the side panels.

Finally, I used to wish the Arc'teryx logo was embroidered, but I just realized it's reflective, so you can be seen when walking at night - especially important with the dark charcoal or black colors!

All in all, a well-designed, great performing, very comfortable, good-looking jacket!  I'll let you know how it does for me on the slopes!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-01-24 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

It's no secret that these lightweight 'fleece alternative' type synthetic jackets have taken the outdoor gear world by storm these last few years with just about every company, big or small, making their own version. I've had a Patagonia Nano Puff pullover since they first came out, and it's been on of my favorites pieces of all time. However, wanting a full-zip jacket version and something more breathable, it came down to either a Nano Air, or this Atom LT.  

The Atom is a little more breathable/less warm than the Nano Air, but it's the perfect companion under a hardshell skiing in less than frigid conditions, or as an everyday piece during the cool months, whether hiking or in town. For other reasons not related to this jacket, Arc'teryx is not a favorite brand of mine and I prefer other brands, but I'll give credit where credit is due. They generally make a good product, and this one is no exception. Fit is trim but not snug and with a nice bit of stretch to accommodate a full range of motion. I've had larges that I've been swimming in excess material, and larges where I can't hug because the shoulders or too tight, but this one sits perfectly in the middle. 

Also, just for comparison sake, I also own a ThermoBall hoody from The North Face. It was given to me by my work and has a large/bulky patch sewn onto the back, so for that reason I don't use it much for backcountry pursuits.

"Patagonia","Dual Aspect Hooded Jacket - Men's","1758708449",4,"I got this, thinking it would be something akin to a Patagonia R1 hoody, but with the benefit of a hard shell's protection.  I'll tell you right now, it's not going to give you the insulation of an R1, and neither will it be as good with the elements as your typical $400+ hardshell.  What this closer resembles is a good softshell, with the added benefit of being remarkably trim.  

I had trouble at first figuring out how to make this work in my kit, and after some trial and error,  I've finally found my 'use' cases:

- For Climbing: the fabric is tough on the outside, so it can take some abuse.  Best for climbing when it's 35-50 degrees F outside and you're anticipating a little inclement weather. 
- For Jogging/Hiking: It'll block wind, but it's still breathable.  I love it for jogging, because it'll handle crappy weather with ease, and the slimmish fit moves well.  When it get's really cold, throw an R1 or maybe even just a Capilene baselayer underneath and you should be set.
- For Everyday Use: If it's brutally cold, but sunny out, I'd probably opt for your average mid-layer, like the Arcteryx LT Atom or Nano Puff, but if the temps are sitting around 40 degrees F and you think the weather will turn bad (notice a trend here?), either layer the Dual Aspect Hoody on top or wear it by itself.

MY ""SHORT"" GRIPE: Not so much the hoody itself, but more an observation of Patagonia - I don't feel like you guys consider the vertically challenged people out there.  The fit is great, but lengthwise, I feel like someone who's sitting around 5'10"" would probably call this garment a ""perfect fit."" For me, it always ends up being that about 2-4 inches of garment all bunched up around my waist.

I was wearing a quick wick t-shirt and the same in hiking pants. The pace was about 2.5-3 miles per hour. This information to me is important to understand if the jacket really is breathable and well ventilated. At no point in my hike did I feel hot, and at the end I was not sweating.

The only downsides I can seem to find are the fit, and the length of the sleeves.

As other reviews have stated, there is a lot of extra material in the shoulder areas, which is really a bummer. I'm 5'9, lean/athletic, 150lbs, and after pouring over the internet and getting help from a backcountry rep,I went for M size. I wasn't able to try one on beforehand because I'm currently living in Japan. I had to order it to the US and have it forwarded due to international shipping restrictions on the Arc'teryx brand.

The extra material in the shoulders only furthers the extra bunched look thanks to the length of the sleeves. I'll have more room to layer than I really need... The length of the jacket itself is great, the hood is a bit roomy, but that's easy to fix with the strap system. 

I am confident that even the Japanese rainy season will be no match for this jacket, and it will be a great companion in my winter trek through Hokkaido's national parks later this year.

"Arc'teryx","Alpha AR Jacket - Men's","106599048",3,"I can relate to another review in this post regarding the sizing and fit of this jacket. First, I am a huge Arc'teryx fan and love the quality of their products. After doing much reading/research I took the plunge and purchased the Medium Alpha AR. No local retailer carries it, so I did not have a chance to try it beforehand.

This is a sharp looking jacket (on the hanger). The materials, construction and finish of this product were spot-on as you would expect for a ~$500 jacket. The issue arrises with the fit, there is entirely too much space/fabric around the shoulder areas of this jacket. At first I thought perhaps I just need to layer up and see how it fits. I put on a fleece and the Thorium AR jacket as base layers and tried again. Unfortunately, there were still bunches of material around shoulder area of this jacket. There is a fine line between having enough material for unimpeded movement in the shoulder/upper arm area versus it being excessive - for this jacket it falls in the later.

I have a lean/fit climbers build - the body fit seems on par, the arm length is on the long side (and I have long arms) but I would expect this with this style of jacket, but the shoulder ""situation"" is just excessive. I cannot think of a good design reason for there to be so much room/fabric in this area of the jacket. If I turned into the raging Hulk is might be good fit(?)

I am returning this jacket and will likely get the Alpha SV. I am familiar with the Alpha SV and it does not have the baggy shoulder situation going on. As another reviewer pointed out, the Alpha SV has a more true athletic fit then this jacket.

Sharp, well made jacket, just seems to have a ""wonky"" fit.

Now I just have to wait for another 20% coupon to get the SV!

I had used an older alpha SV from arcteryx for many years and it was superb. The cut, features, and detail were all spot on.
Unfortunately I can not say the same of the Alph AR. Here is why:
First, the cut is not the same, ""tailored"" fit the Alpha SV, and almost all other arcteryx pieces have. It is a bit too baggy in the arms, creating extra folds, while being a bit too constricting in the shoulders/upper chest area. At the same time, the area from the chest down seems to be a bit too baggy. This cut, doesn't really help layering, while adding a lot of material. 
Second problem: the hood only has 2 way adjustability! No 3 way fore-aft adjustability! At this level I thought 3 way adjustability was a foregone conclusion. 
Overall this is probably still a good jacket for most people. But for everyone who is going to be using this jacket day-in and day-out these things will get annoying real fast.
Overall I'd give this a 3.5 stars, but since I can't I''m going with 3.

WHEN: For me this is a 3-season shell, I use it as a stand alone jacket in the spring and fall but may partner it with a midlayer for winter activities. 

WHERE: I use this thing all over, hiking on the trail or going to the office in the city, this shell just works. And it packs down small enough to take with you wherever you go. We are traveling to NZ south island for a few weeks and this jacket is coming (along with my Beta LT). 

WHY: It's the best all-a-rounder, I have other jackets that do some things better but I haven't seen one that can do all these things this well.

STYLE: I love its look and feel. It has sleek simple lines with a perfect athletic cut. Add in this faint lined texture and the outer has an awesome feel. Note: I have a Gamma LT vest that's about 8 years old now and the new texture of the outer is really great. It's one of those things I didn't even know I needed. It's only drawback is the hood makes the collar stand out and look a little funny (I guess that's the price you pay for functionality).

FUNCTION: I “Needed” a good all-a-round jacket. I love to travel and do outdoor actives, so was looking for something have could handle almost any situation.

9 out of 10 
The collar with the hood is its only thing keeping this from being perfect. 
If you're like me and don't like hoods on anything other than a rain shell then the you'll be happy to know the non-hoody version of this jacket gets a 10 out of 10 in my book. 

Gamma LT vs Gamma MX
I have to say I've wanted a MX for over 10 years now. It's a really cool jacket, but the price always kept it just out of reach.
Quick match up: the MX wins on the cool factor, those extra chest pockets really set it apart from other players in this field and the extra warmth is nice if you're looking to not have to layer (although this was a downside for me living in a warmer climate). Ultimately it was the LT that came from behind and won this match up for me. The LT just fits my life better. The lightweight makes it better for traveling and just a bit more versatile. FYI: I did opt for the Hoody version due to a sale.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-14 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Arc'teryx","Gamma LT Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","105343238",5,"Spent a lot of time selecting a softshell for my specific needs. I wanted something with a high degree of weather / wind protection, uncluttered low-profile design, and no extra insulation. I like to layer a fleece underneath as needed, and prefer to have the option of wearing the shell on its own when it's not so cold. This jacket has served very well in this role. It really feels like a shield from weather and scrapes, and is durable as hell. I wear a Patagonia R2 underneath when it gets cold, and I really don't think it gets much better than this combo. I'm seriously considering buying a second one in another color, it's that good.  If you are looking for stand-alone warmth, you may be better served by the Epsilon LT Hoody.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-10-05 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Arc'teryx","Gamma LT Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","106636683",5,"I got this as a lightweight touring softshell.  It works beautifully as active layer, breathing well, providing protection from wind, cold, and light precip.  It's an anthletic fit so you can layer over it if things get really chilly.  In typical arc'teryx fashion, it's simple and minimalist.  A few well placed zipper pockets, and that's about it.  
One nice feature is is the stretchy cuffs made from a more slippery fabric.  The wrists are a high abrasion area and that fabric allows for better interplay between other fabrics (like on your gloves or mittens).  That same fabric is used in the hood, as well, which saves some weight.  
I'm 5'11"" and 150 lbs and a medium is a good, well tailored fit.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-01-13 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Arc'teryx","Gamma LT Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","492096",4,"I wanted a jacket to do three things: wear dayhiking, snowshoeing and for casual wear.  I previously had a US Army issue softshell until I learned I could sell it for $250+. That jacket had the best softshell material I’ve ever used and if it had been better sewn and not in Army, foliage green, I would have kept it.  
I replaced it with a Marmot ROM that I had for the past year.  It was well built, but boxy and I really didn’t need a jacket that “heavy” with the Gore Windstopper liner.  
 In buying the Gamma LT, I was concerned that it would be too tight in the arm holes, which seems to be a concern for me in other jackets.  I’m not a big guy, but am fit at 5”09” and 185lbs.  The jacket fits great and I can easily layer a base, then a light fleece or sweatshirt.  I can even fit a light puffy under it, but that does start to push the limits of the arm holes.  I ordered a large, but should have also ordered an XL to try on, then returned the one that didn’t fit as well. 
The sleeves are long, but that’s good and prevents them from riding up if you need to reach for something.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the cuffs are not adjustable but seem to be set for where I would if they had Velcro.  As a personal preference, I would still like to be able to adjust my own cuffs as sometime you just need to tighten them down and other times you might want to increase the airflow.  
The body of the jacket is lean which is nice if you’re wearing a pack or moving through brush.  I would prefer to have a little more room so that anything I wear on my belt, including a phone or knife, would not so easily print through the jacket when it’s zipped up.  The back of the jacket is nicely longer than the front, but again I would prefer just another inch of length in front, so that my fleece that’s hanging out isn’t getting wet.  
 The hood as also previously reviewed is very large, but can be cinched down to fit well without a helmet. 
The material itself is both very tough yet comfortable and stretches well.  I’ve had the chance to wear the jacket from below freezing in the 20’s up into the mid’50’s.  The jacket sheds light rain very well, but does start to wet out after 30 or so minutes.  I’ve remained dry underneath, but you just have to remember the limits of the material. I do very much like how breathable it is though.  Just to be clear, there is no lining, backing material or insulation on the interior.
Overall, an excellent piece of gear that should serve me well in a variety of roles.  I got the gray, which surprisingly came with some nice, blue trim along the zippers and collar.  When they make a version all in the same blue, I’ll buy one of those too.

"Arc'teryx","Gamma LT Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","6140771",5,"I purchased the Gamma LT Hoody in late winter after previously owning the Patagonia Guide Hoody.  I really liked the Guide Hoody initially, but there were several design elements I didn't care for.  For instance, I wear size medium and found the sleeves to be excessively long.  While this normally wouldn't be an issue, the Guide Hoody didn't have any method of managing the sleeve length via velcro straps or some type of cinch system.  That issue, coupled with the lack of breathability due to the interior fleece lining led me to look elsewhere for a solid softshell.  I'm pleased to say my search began and ended with the Gamma.  This shell is spectacular in each area the Guide Hoody lacked.  First, Arc'teryx conveniently addressed the previously noted sleeve issue by crafting the base of the sleeve using an elastic fabric that keeps the sleeves in place without the hassle of velcro straps.  They used the same excellent design element on both my Atom LT Jacket and Atom SV Hoody to great affect.  The exterior fabric of the Gamma is made using the Arc'teryx Burly Weave, and it feels bomber.  I have full confidence I can rub the jacket against any surface without causing any wear to the fabric.  It feels super durable, but is also soft to the touch.  Given the durability, when I first received the jacket I thought it wouldn't be that breathable, and I was completely wrong.  The Gamma breathes better than any other layer I own and it is now my three season go-to piece for most outdoor pursuits.  ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-04-29 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Arc'teryx","Gamma LT Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","4323403",5,"For winter, I spend most of my time wearing this jacket. It's the most versatile jacket I've ever owned.

The fit: I am 6'2"", 170lbs and surprisingly bought a small. I can fit an UL down jacket/expedition baselayer underneath. Sleeve length and overall length is great. Size up for more layering options.

Things I've used this jacket for:
Bike commuting in town, snow cave building, snowshoeing, glisadding, shooting, lots of hiking.

Conditions I've used this jacket in: extreme wind, sub zero temps (with a puffy underneath), immersed in powder, wet and dry snow, heavy rain.

Features:
- Huge helmet compatible hood. In high wind, it blows off your head if it's not sinched down. The front of the hood extends far over your head, almost like a hat (which is good during active snowfall). The hood has two draw cords on the side to make it tighter and a rear draw cord to make it tighter-er (?). The bill of the hood is semi-stiff.
- Two huge hand pockets. Mesh lined, easily fit a pair of gloves and a hat in one pocket. There is also an internal chest pocket which fits a phone (no headphone port).
-Two draw cords at the bottom which can be operated with one hand.
-Wind guard behind the main zipper. The hand pockets have a much tighter zipper to keep wind out, but no wind guard. The main zipper has large teeth, is very easy to move, and has a large pull tab.
-Slight drop-tail in the back of about 1-2 inches.
-Cuffs have elastic panel (no velcro)

If I am working vigorously, I won't wear this jacket in temperatures over 30 degrees unless it's windy. Standing still, I am find down to mid 30's with it and just a T-Shirt. Breathability is good compared to any hardshell, but it's a windproof softshell which is limiting.

The outer face sheds snow well. The first places to get wet seem to be behind the neck and upper shoulders for some reason. It stays drier than a windshirt or DWR treated puffy. It does okay in the rain but don't expect it to serve as a rainshell.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-02-26 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

It's great for active pursuits in cold weather.  I've had it out backpacking and hiking and it's just what I wanted.  The fabric appears very durable, but it results in a weight penalty for sure.  I'd say it's highly wind resistant, but definitely not windproof.  The upside is that it is very breathable if you're working hard.  The elastic cuffs and hem draw cord keep the wind out.  The hood is the typical head swallowing ""helmet compatible"" type but the adjustments work well to tailor the fit.   My one complaint is that the hood drawstrings sit inside the jacket, so to adjust you have to unzip; more of a personal inconvenience than a real flaw.  The two hand pockets are mesh lined and extend from below the armpits to the waist and can double as vents.  The pockets are completely accessible with a pack on. 
I'm 6' broad shoulders and the large fits perfect.  It is a true athletic cut and I could get a baselayer and maybe another light layer under it.   Puffy is a no go for me in the arms.
In the end, I don't think I'd pay full price.  Wait for a coupon or sale on this one; still a good piece, just not full price great.

Marmot classifies the fit as regular, and for the most part this is true. I'm a little bit bigger around the midsection (too many donuts when I was young and foolish) so it fits me a little tighter, but there is still room for a baselayer underneath. The 600-fill down works like a champ and is comfortable down into 10-degree temperatures. A couple of minor gripes though...first, at least for me, is a bit of a shoulder-pad look. It's not ""A Flock Of Seagulls""-like, but it's definitely there. Second, the collar is a little taller than I like, but like I said, minor gripes that are just personal preference.

Overall this is a pretty good piece of gear. It's not the lightest or the most packable, but it will do the job fairly well.

Also, I'm not a huge fan of hoods, but I love jackets that have them, it just feels nice around your neck, and with the high collar of this jack along with another fleece lined front zipper area near your chin, makes this jacket my go-to for comfort and style.

"Outdoor Research","Diode Hooded Down Jacket - Men's","109074890",5,"As others have noted, it has a slimmer fit, but its slight form-factor makes it perfect for layering over (soft/hard shell, etc.). On the other hand, I'm 6', 185lbs. and the medium fits me perfectly. I'm a bit soft in the midsection, so the fill compresses a little when I pack layers beneath it, but there is no pulling of the fabric/stitching. Still, if you plan to layer a lot, or are a between-sizer, the large would still fit slimmer than most medium puffers. I noticed cold spots when I first put it on in 35 degree weather, but I do not notice any now, after regular wearing. I suspect that giving it a good shake upon purchase would help eliminate any threat of cold spots. Also, the gusseting and longer arms help reduce lifting and exposure around belly or wrists. 

All that said, it's an amazing jacket: comfy, warm, more durable than the average pure pertex quantum, light, packable, great attention to detail (love the wrist closures -- hook-and-loop as well as elastic), hand warmer pockets.

I find the fit to be true if not a tad snug—I’m 5.9, 167 lbs with a 40” chest and have a medium. You might consider ordering a large if you want more layering room.
You can read through the product description to get the tech-specs and whatnot, but the features that really stand out to me are:  
•	Sheds light rain; heavy rain or all day mist will start to seep but, I’ve gotten it pretty wet and the down never clumped—dries fast, overall pretty impressive in this regard.
•	Thoughtfully reinforced high-wear spots, yet this jacket still maintains a light-weight build. 
•	Two-way zippers.
•	Pocket stuff sack (a must for any belay/bivy jkt).
•	The hood is huge, fits a climbing helmet, but also cinches down comfortably.
•	Huge internal pockets (another must for gloves and those times you need to put a hot-water bottle inside your coat).
•	The wire brim in the hood is super thick, and surprisingly effective in keeping warmth in.
•	Outstanding mobility due in part to the slight form-fit.

This thing is feature packed which I love! huge ""stuff it"" style pockets inside,higher hand pockets, fully adjustable hood and velcro sleeves.  Double seperating zippers are a subtle but key feature for me.  
Admittedly those features made me keep the jacket cause I am very let down in its actual warmth. 
Having owned the Incandescent, Choas, superlayer, and transcendent jackets over the years I was lead to believe this would be in the thicker ""expedition"" style or belay jacket. But its only about as warm as a Transcendent, other mid layer puffys.

I have tried to layer together with RHO LTW as base and cerium SV as mid layer. In terms of length, it's thigh length. Ceres in medium is slightly longer than Theta SVX in the same size. 

This jacket is light for the amount of insulation it provides and is very comfortable to wear. It can be use as a daily jacket if you live in the place with constant cold  weather. 

I have not tried the extreme parkas from other brands but Ceres is definitely the warmest piece in Arcteryx line up. If you feel the 225g of Down in Ceres is not enough you can always double up by wearing Cerium SV (185g of Down) as a mid layer. 

As a down jacket, Ceres is best use in Dry condition however general wet condition won't be an issue due to its Windstopper outer fabric.

When you place your hands into the pockets fully (without a pack on) the positioning causes large amounts of stress to the lower part of the pocket stitching and zipper and consequently causes one's arms/shoulders to be uncomfortably positioned or makes you look like you are half cocked to do the chicken dance. This detracts from the overall diverse functionality of the jacket for me. More so, when the pockets are loaded, with or without a pack, the depth issue can cause multiple problems.

Long version: I like this jacket and Marmot's M3 material so much that when my first Estes was unfortunately misplaced when traveling, I did't hesitate to replace it.  The breathability and stretchability of the M3 material means this jacket is comfortable when active and I typically don't feel the need to take it off when I get back indoors. This jacket is not intended to be your rain shedder, but it does well in a light rain in my experience and won't soak through. The velcro cuffs are nice to have and don't make the ends of the sleeves feel overly stiff.

How I use it: I often use this jacket for some weather protection when its cool outside (45- 65) and I may want a hood handy. I reach for it when walking around town, walking my dog, or when on shorter bike rides (<10mi).

What I wouldn't use it for: When it gets colder (upper 20- 40's) I reach for my Marmot Prodigy or Arc'teryx Gamma MX.

Therefore I think maybe the Gamma LT is better because it gives you a bit more room on the inside to layer as needed. The down side is the MX has better pockets.

Snowbird was opening early for the first time in a couple years and I wanted to make sure I had all my ski gear prepped: ski, boots, poles, helmet, goggles, gloves, etc. And of course my Arc'teryx Theta SVX Jacket and Marmot Spire Pants. I packed my Osprey Talon backpack and laid everything else in a pile ready to go for the morning.

11/30/15 - My fellow Expert Gearhead Geoff Connor picked me up early to head up Little Cottonwood and lucky for us conditions were looking fantastic (at least in the higher elevations). We got to the Tram parking and started to assemble our gear and then the ""Oh Sh**!""  moment - I had forgotten my Theta SVX. Lucky for me Geoff is a climber and had his climbing gear in his car including the uber-versatile Gamma MX. Temps were in the teens and the wind was howling but I survived with a Patagonia baselayer, light Vest and the Gamma. It might have helped that I am a tele skier and the first day of making lunges down 3,000 feet of hardpack kept me working pretty hard.

I am a short (5' 7""), out of shape (~200lbs) guy who lives in the city and goes to the snow twice a year.  This jacket is not being used for it's ""intended"" or ""designed"" purpose. I ordered both the L and XL.  I returned the L because it would be great if I was going to climb or do hiking in the snow but that wasn't the fit I wanted for my around town casual use.

The reasons I LOVE this jacket are the look, fit (except for arm length), and warmth/breathability.  It has the look and fit of something not super technical (since it got the XL) and not super baggy.  I have a hard time with that since I am shorter and fatter than your average reviewer here.  For me it is the perfect fit for an everyday jacket.  The arms are too long but the cuffs make it a non issue.  The warmth/breathability has been exactly what I was looking for.  I knew the upside/downside of softshells prior to purchase.  (know what you're getting if you've never bought one)  I can comfortably wear this on cooler summer nights and all day during the fall and spring here in Yokosuka, Japan.  It's heavier/not as breathable as the OR Ferrosi but lighter/more breathable than the North Face Apex Boinic.

I am 6' and 165 pounds and have a 38"" chest.  I went with the size large and I think it was definitely the right call as the jacket sizes small in my opinion.  With the large, it is not too big / roomy with nothing but a base layer underneath and it has enough room to put a small / medium fill down layer underneath.   Also, it is highly wind and water resistant, and the look and feel / texture of the jacket is absolutely amazing.  In addition, the cut is superb (allows for great freedom of movement), the pockets are well designed (zippers are perfect and pocket sizing is robust), and the color really pops to make it an instant favorite.

"Arc'teryx","Gamma MX Hooded Softshell Jacket - Men's","465988",4,"Overall, I've been really pleased with the Gamma MX Hoody. I like all the pockets, although one (left) chest pocket would have been sufficient (in addition to the handwarmer pockets). Also, my sleeve pocket doesn't get much use. The handwarmer pockets are large, with a large zippered opening. The hood fits reasonably well with a knit cap underneath. The hood is sized for a helmet, but it can be snugged up adequately when wearing just a knit cap.

I had a Gamma MX jacket in size medium from a few years ago, and it was a bit too snug for my tastes (I couldn't layer with it). I purchased a size large in the Gamma MX Hoody, and I am happy with it. I am 5'10""+ and 165 pounds. The size large leaves room for a Patagonia Nano Puff or Down Sweater underneath, and the size large isn't a tent with thinner layers. The sleeves are really long, but better a bit too long than a bit too short. The cuffs are a bit tight (hard to get over your hands), but that's no big deal.

We frequently have a lot of wind where I live along the Colorado Front Range, so I usually wear a somewhat windproof base layer under the jacket (e.g., the Patagonia Nano Puff). It has been cold and windy since I got the jacket, so I have not yet had a chance to test it with a wind permeable mid-layer in calmer (non-windy) conditions.

Built quality seems to be first rate; we'll see how it does down the road. So far, I am enjoying the size large Gamma MX Hoody much more than my former Gamma MX jacket in medium. Cheers!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-11-24 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Outdoor Research","Realm Jacket - Men's","2111839716",5,"After giving up on hardshells due to lack of breath ability, I think I've found the one for me. The Realm is everything I want from a shell: light, comfortable, breathable, waterproof, and VERSATILE. So far I've only used this during backcountry ski season, but I'm excited to take it to the crag and the trails.

The first thing I noticed about the jacket is how light it is. Even with a wire brim adjustable hood, 2 pockets, and velcro wrist tabs, the jacket weights just 11 ounces... that's light for a jacket with these features and it's one of the reasons why the Realm is so comfortable. 

But the best part of the jacket is the membrane. AscentShell is OR's proprietary version of Polartec Neoshell. What does that mean? It means this thing BREATHES and at a price much lower than other Neoshell jackets.  I've worn this skinning and while I did get a little wet underneath, this jacket handled the perspiration much better than any other hardhsell I've worn.  For reference, I usually skin in just a baselayer top, maybe a light fleece if it's chilly... I'm a very sweaty dude.  What's really impressed me with this jacket is that I'll skin/boot up, whack the jacket on, ski, and by the end of the run I'm dry underneath. I was sweaty as hell when I started, but dry at the bottom.

But all because this is breathable, doesn't mean it won't protect you. I've been out in this when wet snow was falling and no issues at all with wetting out or leaking. I'll definitely be bringing this with me on climbs when I'm thinking it could get nasty out. This guy even packs into it's own interior pocket and has a clip loop.

The feature that I appreciate the most, and this will sound funny, is the wrist closures. Yes, the wrist closures.  Often time jackets have wrists that are too wide, too narrow, awkwardly shaped, with bad velcro, etc. But OR nailed it on this. Half elastic and half velcro means that you don't *need* to redo the wrists every time you take the jacket on/off, but when you do it's super easy and locked down. Cuffs fit well over/under pretty much all gloves I've used, and especially when wearing a large watch such as an Ambit.

Sizing is spot on. Slim enough so it's comfortable and looks good, but definitely enough room to layer. Tucked under a harness, it won't be billowing over the top and make you look like a mutant mushroom.

I haven't been super excited on a piece of gear in a bit, but I really am enthusiastic about this piece and can't wait to see how it does over the long run. No concerns as of yet other than long term durability, but that's the tradeoff that I'm willing to pay for a super light piece of gear.

I encourage you to reach out directly if you have any questions on this or other jackets, such as:
- Can you explain all these membranes to me?
- What jacket is right for me?
- What other lightweight gear do you recommend?

Overall, I'm not very impressed with this version and I wish I had gone with the standard r1. 
The r1 field's reinforcement panels add quite a bit of bulk and stiffness, making it less packable, and the horizontal pocket is very difficult to open with one hand (however the horizontal pocket can be friggin sweet because it perfectly fits a beer can! So awesome around the campfire!). One if my biggest problems with it is the sleeve cuffs; since I hoped to use this for rock climbing I needed to be able to pull up the sleeves to keep my hands free from obstruction. I see people do this with the r1 all the time, but with the r1 field the reinforcement panels make the sleeves stiffer and not stretchy enough to pull up and keep in place. The stiffness and looser fit also make this jacket less convenient to layer. It just doesn't feel right underneath my nano air or hard shell, and the sleeves bunch up.

This jacket did not meet my needs, but with that being said I do think it is a good jacket. It would be good for manual labor outside in colder weather, or for other outdoor activities but in my opinion it does not make a good layering piece and it's not good for rock climbing. 
Since getting this jacket I've talked to many of my friends with r1s and the pilling and durability never seem to be a problem. If you're thinking about getting this jacket for layering or climbing, go with the r1 hoody or standard r1 despite what some reviewers say about durability.

Moderately warm - my last fleece was an R2, and the Patagonia was warmer (under a shell, at least - the R2 was not water or wind resistant at all, plus it was so furry looking, to the point that I hardly ever wore it alone).

Fits just perfect, not baggy at all (as I saw others complain). Sleeves length is as it should be, as is the overall length. I've put on a little weight over the last year from 5.11 and 185 to about 200#, but cannot say the fit is worse, just a little tighter, as expected. 
While hiking, I used this as my main jacket over a short sleeve T. Found it held surprisingly well against mild breezes and easily down in the high 30s. It only works if you move. If you expect this to keep you warm while sitting down waiting for sunrise, you will be disappointed. It's not what it is meant for. But throw a light hybrid shell on top (like the Alpha Comp) and you will be surprised how well it holds. 
The built in hood comes in incredibly useful while skiing. I had a Gore Bike wear head/face mask I used before and was curious how well does this hold. And it does great. While it really doesn't have the wind resistance of the Gore, so it won't be useful in extreme cold with gale strength winds, for regular skiing purposes it's just perfect. I use the Fortrez over a REI merino base and under a Procline Hybrid and it did great down to 5F. Below that I had to change plans...
As far as resistance of the fabric... I washed it at least 15-20x and it still feels and looks as new. No piling. No loss of anything. No holes. 
I'm genuinely puzzled reading some of the posts here. I'm not sure how to interpret them based on my own experience. I'm not an Arc super-fan.

Materials were 95% polyester w/5% spandex compared to 100% Poly on the Arc'ty. I liked the stretchy feeling better with the spandex. Mine also had reinforcements all over with bigger nicer pockets.

I echo the sentiments below that the waist is very wide and the lack of drawstring causes the fleece to lose a ton of its insulating property. The fleece material was also much thinner than I expected, leaving me with a beautiful piece of clothing that barely keep me warm. If it is below about 55 degrees outside and even the slightest bit windy I need to layer considerably over this particular fleece.

If you are looking for something a little thicker, try the Arenite or Straibo. I do believe this fleece is well made and works well for its intended purpose (an active layer) but the lack of waist drawstring and bag-like fit at the bottom do not combine well.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-03-25 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

I wear a small in most brands: Nike, JCrew, etc. 

I wear this while working outside in the winter (carpentry) with a Smartwool baselayer and a $20 softshell jacket to take the abuse. This setup is fine for anything above 15F, if it gets colder I add a NorthFace Thermoball jacket. The balaclava was awesome last week when when windchill dropped below. Haven't noticed it when I'm not using it, in fact I forgot about it until I my face was numb and I needed a fix. I've been wearing this for 2 weeks straight and as another review said, I don't ever want to take it off. Took it for a hike on a 40F day with a little wind. It seemed to block a reasonable amount of wind which was surprising. The hardface is great, looks brand new still. 

In short, a great piece if you know what you're expecting. I already owned the Thermoball insulated jacket so I didn't want to get the Atom LT or a similar piece.

Things I like:
-Look - This is a super sleek fleece, and probably my favorite from an aesthetic perspective. 
-The hood and built in balaclava are excellent. The hood fit is perfect for a midlayer, and the balaclava is exceptionally nice for activities like cycling. When it is stowed, you would never know it's there. 
-Comfort is great. The fleece is very soft, and the amount of stretch is perfect.
-Fit for cycling - this fleece honestly fits very similarly to what you might expect from a made-for-cycling piece of apparel, which I found surprising. In the context of cycling, this is my favorite midlayer.

Things I don't like:
-Fit for other things - Unfortunately, I can't say that I'm particularly thrilled about how this jacket fits for activities off of a bike. Ironically, I purchased this more for use climbing. What I have found is that the shoulders are too restricted to be very comfortable for activities like climbing that require a lot of overhead arm movement. If you're staying relatively still, the fit is great, but once you start moving your upper body a lot, it feels restrictive.

In sum, I definitely am a fan of this piece, and would likely buy it again, simply because it's so good for bicycle commuting. That said, it's not as much of a knock-out piece as one typically expects from Arc'Teryx, and I think it actually falls a little short for its intended purpose.

"Patagonia","Nano Puff Bivy Insulated Pullover - Women's","656650674",4,"As much as I've loved wearing this jacket around town on warmer winter days, crazy Utah spring  weather, and cool summer evenings in the mountains, it really has been more of a casual jacket for me rather than a technical piece. I just can't find where it fits in to my jacket arsenal as far as layers go. If I want a warm layer, I'll just go with my down sweater, if I want a lighter piece I'll go with something breathable like the Nano Air hybrid. I'm sure there is a place for it, but I tend to be freezing or overheating, so when I find my ideal layering pieces, I don't tend to stray to far from my favorites. 

That being said, I have been reaching for this one as my camping layer this summer, and as far as an every day jacket goes, here's why this pullover is great: 
THE POUCH: Honestly, all jackets should have a pouch like this one. I can run into stores without a purse, and put my phone, keys, and wallet in the magical  pouch--it's holds SO much--plus there are still pockets for my hands. I also have an irrational fear of being somewhere without a snack--I can stash all kinds of goodies in this pouch!
COMFORT: Super soft, super comfortable. I love my pullover Patagonia fleece, but you know when you try to take it off and all your shirts underneath come with it, and your arms are stuck, and your head is stuck, and you kinda look like an idiot when you have to ask for help to get the pullover off your head? (You know this has happened). This actually just pulls right off you head--no flashing your friends, no asking for help.
It's not baggy, it's not fitted, it's just right. 

The hood doesn't do much for me--it's tiny, but I'll for sure take this into some chilly canyons in the fall-I know it will fit great under a helmet.

It's been my go-to casual layer for running errands, hikes with the dog, and bopping around town. 

As a technical layer, I find the cut to be a downside. It's great to layer beneath and wear as an outermost layer in town, but I find that looseness in the hip, particularly,  makes it bunch oddly underneath a shell for other uses. It does best, in my opinion, as an outer-most layer.

The fit is great for me, allowing room for a hoodie underneath,  while maintaining comfort. I also appreciate the length: just about butt-length on my 5'6"" frame.

I'm 99% of the time a medium in Patagonia, and the same holds true for the Bivy. Even with my larger bust, sometimes a fit issue, it fits supremely well in a medium","EMPLOYEE","2017-03-31 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer","true"
"Patagonia","Nano Puff Bivy Insulated Pullover - Women's","106312630",5,"I'm a big fan of the Nano Puff series, it was no surprise that I totally fell in love the Nano Puff Bivy Pullover. It effortlessly waffles between a true technical piece and a lifestyle jacket. I'm able to wear this pullover while skiing or hiking, though I do foresee myself wearing it while climbing come warmer months.  And (best of all), I can wear it to work without having to think twice about whether or not it looks out of place. The under-the-helmet hood is awesome not to mention, actually fits under the helmet, which not-so-subtly hints at the versatile design of Patagonia's products. 

Meanwhile, the coolest part about this pullover is the fact that it touts a largely recycled construction. The exterior material is entirely recycled, which is awesome if you're an eco-conscious shopper, and the Primaloft Gold Eco insulation touts a 55% post-consumer recycled content—so I'm able to feel good about wearing this piece. 

The pockets are stellar: the kangaroo pocket provides quick and easy respite for cold digits—an ideal detail that has come in handy for me when I walk the dogs. The zippered pocket keeps necessities (e.g. snacks!) close at hand and secure without getting in the way of my arms. The center front zipper allows me to dump excess body heat quickly without forcing me to remove the jacket in its entirety.

As for the fit: I long struggled with the cut and design of the Nano Puff pullovers - I really liked the idea of them, but could never get the right fit. In the past, they were either too tight in the shoulders or too short in the torso which made reaching for holds while climbing not only difficult, but kind of unpleasant thanks to the hem lift and the restrictive shoulders. 

Thankfully, the 2017 rendition seems to have absolved this issue just about entirely. In comparison to years' prior, the Nano Puff Pullover is more ""true to size"" than it does run large. I typically can wear an XS or Small in Patagonia items, with XS being a more ""true to fit"" and a Small being more relaxed. I own a Small and the fit is definitely relaxed, thus being true to size. That being said, this is intended to be a proper midlayer, so how you prefer your midlayers to fit (be it snug or slightly relaxed) is entirely up to you. I prefer to have the option to layer underneath the jacket should the conditions call for it, hence why I chose the Small rather than the XS.

Bottom Line: This piece provides me with the dependable and versatile performance I've come to love and know from the Nano Puff series, but now features a better fit design than years' prior.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-03-07 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Patagonia","Nano Puff Bivy Insulated Pullover - Women's","2873523",5,"Overall, 5 stars because this jacket is sweet looking (that's all that really matters). 

STYLE:
This is a really unique look compared to what we have available to us - the kangaroo pouch is coming back in style! The contrasted colored zippers makes the jacket pop a little more and the colors are clutch, true to form for Patagonia.

FUNCTIONALITY:
Let's be real folks - this jacket couldn't get more functional. Well, maybe if we added sleeve pockets and a chest zipper, but it isn't needed here. Your marsupium (derived from the Latin word ""marsuppium,"" which means a purse or a pouch.) will hold anything you need for the day. I took a trip to Lowe's with my wallet, phone, keys, portable battery charger and 2 doorknobs in there. I looked a little puffier, but I wouldn't normally carry doorknobs. I hate purses and this thing makes it possible to ditch the bag. I also don't have to worry about things falling out of my pocket. I don't recommend actually putting a child in there - I tried and he almost fit (10 lb baby, in case you wondered).  The kangaroo pouch is SEPARATE from side hand entry pocket - so it's almost like you have two pockets, but they occupy the same belly space. I find it easier to put my phone in side entry pocket and everything else in the pouch so I don't have to dig for my phone. 

WARMTH:
If I could rate this separately, I would. I'd probably give it a 4 star. That said, we all know Primaloft just doesn't compare to real down, but it's a lot easier to take care of. It's all about preference. I tested my nano puff out in below freezing temps as my main jacket source. I was not as toasty as I am in my Ghost Whisperer:  http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-ghost-whisperer-hooded-down-jacket-womens?skid=MHW00AY-BK-XS&ti=U2VhcmNoIFJlc3VsdHM6Z2hvc3Qgd2hpc3BlcmVyOjE6NjpnaG9zdCB3aGlzcGVyZXI=

I wear the GW every day as my main - but the nano puff just wasn't made for those temps on it's own. If it's a chilly day in the office, treat it like a hoody and it's perfect, and you might actually get too warm. Throw on a shell or another jacket over the nano puff and you will be golden - it insulates as it's supposed to. I was perfectly warm with another jacket over top and just kept the nano puff on as a hoody.

My only other complaint is that after about 2 wears, I started to notice the primaloft fuzz coming out of the seams a bit. This is minor, but I don't want to lose all the insulation over time! It's not noticeable unless you pay super close attention. 

THE HOOD (yes this gets its own section):
Without a scarf, my neck would have froze. Some jackets have a puffy enough hood to kind of keep the wind out when the hood is down. This hood is DESIGNED for a helmet, so it's super small laying on your back - but once you pull it up, that thing will keep ALL air out. And you will look like you are getting ready to go up in space.  If you need that kind of security in your life, this hood is the bomb diggity. I don't really and only pull it up to get a few laughs. It will surely matte your hair down and leave an elastic marking on your forehead, but if you have a helmet on, that thing isn't going anywhere. 

THE FIT:
Runs a bit small. I am a Medium in Patagonia through and through and sometimes find their stuff to run a little big. Because of the material of this jacket - it doesn't have any give or stretch, so getting it on over my shoulders and situated makes me not want to take it off a million times, but once it's on, it fits perfectly. The only part that is a bit snug is around my hips, but I have bigger hips. I am 5'2"" and a size 6 or 8  in pants, but because I am shorter, it probably hits me lower that it will if you are taller and the hip thing might not even be an issue. I have a medium in this, I typically wear small or medium in Women's clothing. I feel like a large would be too big on me in the shoulders and look silly, and a small would be too tight around my hips.

Overall, I say GET THIS JACKET!! :) ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-04 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

"Patagonia","Performance Better Sweater Fleece Jacket - Women's","656650674",5,"I'm a sucker for jackets. Patagonia is one of my all time favorite makers-of-jackets, and I have spent a lot of hours in my Houdini this summer and the R2 has always been a cooler weather favorite. With temperatures in Utah finally dropping, this fleece has quickly made it to a top choice in my jacket rotation. 

The first thing I noticed is that when I slip it on it fells like a warm fuzzy hug. The inside is super cozy fleece that feels AWESOME--it's honestly the jacket I reach for every morning when I go out back to grab eggs (and the pockets are nice and big!)  I'm pretty slim, and most Patagonia jackets tend to fit a bit more on the boxy side--not this one. It's slim fit, and the stretch panels on the side not only allow for movement when hiking or climbing, but give it a flattering silhouette also (I like the fit so much more than the R2 fleece from a couple years ago).
It's thick enough that it really keeps the chill off when I'm up in the cool mountain air, but not so thick that it limits physical activity or range of motion. I think this is going to be a new favorite for winter running, a great mid-layer when it really gets cold, and I think it will be perfect for winter climbing trips in the desert. 

One last thing I want to talk about that is never mentioned enough, it the no-stink-factor with so many of Patagonia's layers. I've worn this up a few peaks in the last month, and then throw it on to run errands around town, because it still smells great :)

"Patagonia","Nano-Air Light Hybrid Insulated Jacket - Women's","656650674",5,"I am pretty much Goldilocks when it comes to body temp--I have  a hard time finding a happy balance between too hot and too cold. I have been pulling out this jacket for the last several months for all different weather conditions. 

Cold Temps:  When I'm running in the cold, I heat up pretty quickly, and often find myself overheating in 20-30 degree runs in most jackets. I've tried every combination of layers but if the sun is shining I usually end up too warm and sweaty--even in two feet of snow. I honestly don't understand how this jacket breaths and vents like it does--but it makes it extremely comfortable to run in cold temperatures. With 20-30 degree temps I was comfortable with just a tank and this piece--it keeps my core warm, and my armpits breathing, with NO overheating and no sticky soggy layers--where does all the moisture go??! I have no idea how it works, but it does!

Rain: I have worn this jacket in light to medium rain/sleet/ hail/ snow, and literally watched the moisture bead up and roll right off. It's so breathable, it doesn't offer up the same wind protection as something like the Houdini or Airshed, but for running in moisture it has been great.

Summer climbing: We love to head up high to beat the summer temps, but again, since I'm Goldilocks, I tend to be cold standing in the shade belaying ,or early morning climbs before the sun hits the wall. I love this jacket because it's super comfortable, allows for full range of motion, and I can belay and climb without having to take my jacket off--I don't heat up too much when I start to climb.

Fit/Features: This jacket does run a bit larger than other Patagonia jackets--it's more of a relaxed fit. I love the thumbholes on the sleeves, and this jacket does a pretty good job fending off the stink--I really can't remember the last time I washed it. I was nervous with how soft it is that it wouldn't do well against the rocks, but I've climbed in it and there is no wear at all.

"Patagonia","Nano-Air Light Hybrid Insulated Jacket - Women's","106312630",5,"Where do I even begin? I'll try to take it easy on the modifiers, but it's going to be a tremendous challenge!

Back in 2014, the Nano Air completely changed the way I approached layering, not to mention how I viewed synthetic insulation. It was warm both as a standalone piece or layered underneath a shell. It could be worn through wet and dry weather alike and it was so breathable that I didn't have to take it off. That being said, I did have some qualms with the Nano Air: while the fabric pilling was entirely cosmetic, it at times drove me crazy, however more frustrating the jacket (despite its breathable and lightweight constitution) was almost TOO warm at times - especially those when I was really putting the proverbial pedal to the metal. I wanted an insulation layer that had the same, dependable performance as the Nano Air but with a little bit more breathability for my high-output adventures. And obviously, I wasn't the only one who was seeking this kind of layer. 

So who would have thought that Patagonia could possibly out-do themselves by creating a layer that again totally revolutionizes the way I approach layering? Well, they did and yet again, I am totally blown away by the performance and innovation of the Nano Air Light Hybrid jacket. 

I typically wear the Nano Air Light Hybrid while running in cold conditionsÃ¢ÂÂboth road and trail, however I've also worn it resort skiing, hiking, and around town. I've largely been able to gather the effectiveness of the jacket's new technology while running, as its when I sweat the most, yet require core warmth. To say the least, it's been a highly effective midlayer / standalone piece. I will say, when I've worn it skiing, I've been cold on the chairlift, but once I get moving it's incredibly cozy. I typically wear the Nano Air Light Hybrid layered atop a lightweight merino wool baselayer and that seems to be the best methodology of layering for me. Or, should I need extra warmth, I pair it with the Merino Air and that seems to be more than sufficient.

Starting with the easy stuff: the pilling issue seems to be completely absolved. The fabric seems to have a little bit more of a hardy constitution that is less inclined to pill. That being said, I've had the Nano Air Light Hybrid less than a year and my Nano Air is going on 3 years of heavy-duty use, so it's no surprise that I have yet to see any pilling occur.

Okay, now onto the technical stuff: the knit panels are the stuff of legends. This is exactly the change that needed to be madeÃ¢ÂÂwhen I start to warm up, the knit panels seem to preemptively pull the moisture away from my baselayer and push it to the outside of the knit panels (in turn drying quickly and ensuring that I remain comfortable), not to mention the knit panels are innately breathable, so I'm able to regulate my temperature with minimal effort. 

Meanwhile, the Full Range insulation is still as mobile, breathable, and lightweight as ever. The core panels (combined with the lining) safeguard my precious body heat, and the insulation at the top of the sleeves and shoulders not only provides warmth, but also protects me from moisture, wind, and precipitation (which, if you've ever had cold or/and wet arms before, you know it's not fun). Not to mention, the extra DWR treatment is really convenient, though its performance is relatively self evident.

As for the subtle design features: the thumbhole cuffs are awesome. That might be one my favorite features of this jacket - and for once, they're at the right length! I've long struggled with Patagonia's thumbholes, but I don't have a problem with these. 

Regarding the fit: I have a Small and it seems to fit slightly relaxed on me. Albeit it's incredibly comfortable and I still have unimpeded mobility, however I'm sort of in-between an XS and Small with Patagonia's fit model. So I can go with either size. All in all, I'm sold on this jacket and I highly (bigly) recommend it to folks looking for a breathable, insulated layer.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-02-01 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

I bought it mostly for camping because I needed something to put on when the sun set. It works perfectly for that but also as a great winter and early spring top. When it's extra brisk out you'll love have a nano-puff handy. It's lightweight but very warm. My only complaint is that it feels fragile. I'm afraid of it getting caught on something and tearing it. I already snagged the stitching on it and I'm not very happy about that...

I have the Down Shirt, but needed something warmer and did not want to wear my bulky ski jacket on other outdoor activities. I originally ordered this in a small because my Down Shirt is a small. The small fit too tight around my hips and was a little squished in general so I exchanged for a medium. I took the medium out that day snowshoeing and immediately realized that it was way too big and bunched in the torso area making it awkward to carry a backpack with the chest and waist straps clipped. It was also incredibly warm, which is awesome for a stroll outside, but not so great when hiking a bit of elevation, or doing some snowshoeing in a little powder; I overheated and had to unzip most of the way. With that being said, I live in Colorado where even a 10° day can feel like spring if the sun is shining and there's no humidity in the air. I really loved the look, color, and quality of this jacket (and figured I could live with the hot-box warmth), so I decided to switch back to the size small. I went to the store to exchange once again, and while there, I ended up trying on the hooded Down Sweater (small) and found that the fit was different, but perfect. The Down Sweater is a tad bit shorter than the Hi-Loft, and cuts in slightly at the torso reducing the ""bulge/bunching"" in the stomach area. I have a thin upper body, but a wider hip and bum area which is why the longer Hi-Loft jacket just wasn't fitting right.

"Patagonia","Ultralight Down Hooded Jacket - Women's","106312630",5,"I picked up this jacket about a week ago, and have been wearing it for just about every endeavor since then (with the exception of a warm bluebird hike with the dogs). I was looking for a lightweight down alternative to my go-to Nano Air, which still holds the reigning crown for The Best Jacket Ever, but it now has a hard and fast contender for which one I grab.

I stepped outside of my box as far as the fit is concerned, and picked up a Medium rather than my go-to Small or Extra-Small. And while the medium certainly is baggy, it fits akin to a mid-thigh parka. The sleeves are a little long and the shoulders are a bit loose, but I'm far from phased as the fit doesn't impede my mobility. Though, regardless of my happiness with its size, I would recommend to anyone else that you pick up your go-to size in this jacket. 

This jacket lives up to its name and is indeed ultralight - I would venture to say it's barely noticeable when I've worn it layered beneath a hard shell or on its own. The hood is fairly generous, so I'm grateful for the adjustable drawcord. The hand pockets are not lined, nor do they have down insulation backing them so don't expect them to offer warm respire for cold paws. The chest pocket easily accommodates an iPhone 6. And while this certainly wasn't something I take issue with, the Feather Grey colorway is really quite dapper, and despite the incredibly thin and lightweight constitution of the Pertex exterior, no down feathers are physically visible through the material - which I know some folks aren't a fan of. 

I run pretty darn cold, so I decided the best way for me to test this jacket's warmth-to-weight ratio was while skiing in freaking-bitter-cold temperatures this weekend. Utah was bestowed with a glorious amount of powder, so I knew I'd be working hard at random points during the day which, again, I figured would test the jacket's adaptability and breathability. I layered the Ultralight with a Nano Air vest (which is debatable as to whether or not that was necessary - jury's still out on it), Merino Air hoodie, and the Untracked hard shell jacket. There were definitely moments in which I was too hot, which I chalked up to the unnecessary donning of the Nano Air vest. But all in all, I was super comfortable, cozy, and regulated my temperature with ease. Plus, the extra length came in handy when I was sitting on cold chairlifts.

Bottom Line: this jacket performed stupendously. It kept me cozy, regulated my temperature, and breathed really quite well. Admittedly, I wasn't expecting the Ultralight to perform as well or even close to the performance of the Nano Air, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it did. Though, I still prefer the innate adaptability of the Nano Air as it's crafted with synthetic insulation and the down of the Ultralight doesn't fair well in wet weather (though, it does just fine when layered beneath a waterproof hard shell). I'm interested to see how this jacket fairs in the long run.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-12-27 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

Since I have pretty narrow hips, I have no issues there, though if it were made in an XXS I would definitely choose that since I wear this generally over a single baselayer and maybe a light fleece insulator, like an R1 or thermal-weight Capilene. However, the fit is comfortable for me.

PERFORMANCE: I recently wore this on a several day trip to romp around some of my favorite parks, and the weather was chilly, damp, and generally dreary. It was a perfect companion all trip long--on a cold train, in the parks, hanging outside with my dog at night, etc. I run cold, and this performed very well all the way down to about 45 degrees F. Below that, I have to throw on an extra layer underneath (no big deal), or I would go up to the next jacket (e.g., Patagonia's Down Sweater Hoody). The thing I most appreciate about this jacket (besides traceable down) is how lightweight it is for how warm it is. I plan on this being my go-to jacket for many more trips (let alone errands around town, to and from climbing on chilly days, etc.). My one beef is always the single drawcord for the hem, but this is more of an aesthetic peeve.

BOTTOM LINE: I hesitated about a year to get this jacket, and as soon as I put it on, I didn't want to take it off--I wore it as much as possible for a couple weeks straight (except for an anomalous 80-degree day) because I absolutely love its comfortable level of warmth. Like the Nano Air, I have been tending to keep this on and leave it on, and I cannot wait to see how it performs on bigger objectives.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-10-22 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

After more than 50 days and nights in the backcountry, I washed the jacket and it looks like new again. So I can wear it to work, too!

A few notes: this isn't intended to be a ski-weight winter jacket. It's an ultralight layer for those needing both weight savings and warmth in a three-season layer. I wore this as part of a layering system, with a mid-weight wool base and a rain/wind jacket to keep drafts out. I stayed comfortable most of the time and only moderately chilly (not dangerously cold) when temps dipped into the 20s. I had a down quilt I could have wrapped up in if it got any colder than that. Speaking of the quilt, this jacket was also part of my sleep system on cold nights, providing the hood that a quilt is missing. 

The word ""system"" is key for ultralight hikers. Everything needs to work together.  No single component needs to (or should!) work entirely on its own.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-09-21 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

It is super light, low profile, and stuffs into just about any bag. And I like that the design is a bit different and more modern than your typical down jacket. I have this in black, and it has a nice little sheen to it that I think makes it more fun. Added bonus, I've received more compliments on this jacket than anything else I own!

This number has been with me three years now and it looks just as good today as it did the day bought it - and it has traveled with me errywhere. Seriously awesome. I'm still not sure how it's so durable, it seems like it would rip easily but doesn't. Compare this to a LuLu down jacket I've had for about the same amount of time that will tear if it catches anything.  

There is one tiny, tiny hole that I need to patch. Even with the tiniest of a tear, it does leak feathers, so when you buy the jacket I'd recommend snagging repair tape to keep on hand with you just in case, especially if you plan to wear it a lot on its own (instead of as a layering piece).

It's transformed into the Do-Everything shell (from hiking, biking, trail running, climbing, to resort skiing) thanks to its sleek, athletic construction and dependable windproof and waterproof qualities. I can't get over the fit - however I have noticed that the new Triolet runs a little larger and longer than my edition. The hood is super easy to adjust, as is the hem.

"Patagonia","Triolet Jacket - Women's","5569419",5,"I have the 2012 version of this jacket, but it is without question the toughest, most versatile shell you could ask for. I have used it as a rain jacket while hiking, backpacking and trail running, as a badass wind layer while nordic skiing and mountaineering, and in combination with a puffy as a full-on jacket for downhill skiing. (I bought a size up from what I normally would to be able to pack layers underneath). With 3 layers of Gore-Tex, this baby stays dry much longer and insulates better than your typical rain shell. For warm weather pursuits, this jacket breathes well, and if you need a little extra vent--pit zips to the rescue! The hood is helmet, pom-pom beanie, and top-knot compatible! I do not leave for any type of adventure, regardless of the season, without the Triolet jacket stuffed into my pack.

"Arc'teryx","Alpha SV Jacket - Women's","505555996",5,"Intro: I got this puffy for daily use in SLC in the winter, backcountry use, winter camping/snowshoeing etc. I have used it regularly since I received it and really love it. 

Fit: I am 5’5” (athletic/climber – so sometimes have trouble with tops fitting arms/shoulders) and I ordered a small. I can comfortably wear a fleece jacket or mirco synthetic puffy jacket under this one and I can wear a gortex shell over the top. I normally wear smalls in jackets, but also like a snug/fitted fit. If you like your jackets bigger, then size up. This jacket is a shorter crop than other down jackets. If you have a long torso (I don’t), you would be better off getting one of the longer cut downs. 

Performance/Use: This is one of the warmer arc’teryx puffy jackets and I think it has performed well in its use. Ive used it snowshoe camping when sitting around camp. It keeps me warm in 0-20 degree weather in the Uintas when worn over a baselayer/midlayer and below a gore-shell. I run cold though, so like a LOT of warmth. When doing activity, this jacket packs up fairly small for an 850 fill heavy duty down. If you want a puffy for easy and small packing you might consider getting the AR, LT or SL version of this jacket, though they likely won’t be as warm. I definitely can’t wear this jacket when working out hard, because it gets warm really fast. 

Pros/Cons: Pro: really warm, well made, fits well. Has elastic cinches along waistline to cinch down in cold/windy weather, has cinched sleeves and a well fitted hood. Love the stash sack pocket inside and packs up fairly well. 
Cons: Not waterproof – can’t wear alone in snowy/wet conditions. This jacket does not have a helmet compatible hood so it is not ideal for skiing etc where you would be wearing a helmet. (I did not purchase this for this reason, so not truly a con, but just good to know). If you want a down jacket you can wear skiing with a hood they make ski/board specific jackets that are down with a waterproof exterior shell all in one. This jacket is also potentially short for some who have a longer torso.

"Arc'teryx","Alpha SV Jacket - Women's","3089872",5,"I've had this jacket since Christmas of 2006  (so I'm reviewing a VERY old model here with Gore-Tex XCR instead of Proshell).  So while I can't speak to the specifics of the current model on a day-in-day-out level, I can say this -- it is 2014 -  and this thing has been across the country with me.  It has gone up mountains, down mountains.  It's traveled hundreds of miles off shore (remote-island life and whale watching).  It has lasted through many summers of field work (read: bushwacking, hiking through clearcuts, 5-year old clearcuts, in terrible weather day in and day out).  It has helped me through a master's thesis and 3 different jobs (it even effectively shed my tears when I got laid off when the economy tanked).  It has been outside through the duration of 3 different hurricanes (all activities during hurricanes not endorsed by author).

I'm still dry.  Never once gotten the least bit wet.  Never once did I think it was not breathable enough.   Despite being dragged through terrible brush, it doesn't have holes.  It's a little dirty - but less dirty than anything else I've owned this long.  The older models fit tighter than the newer models - so that's something to keep in mind - both Arc'T and Backcountry are great at helping you find the right size if you need.

I had purchased it specifically for an upcoming backpacking trip as it promised lightweight, waterproof breathability. Fortunately I tested it before the trip on a practice hike, because as it turned out it was nowhere close to being H2NO - quite the opposite.

"Patagonia","Stretch Rainshadow Jacket - Women's","109774654",5,"The ultralight Stetch Rainshadow is one of the lightest fully-featured rain shells I have ever used. Weighing a scant 9.2 oz, the very packable Stretch Rainshadow has pit zippers, dual hand pockets, a drawcord hem, adjustable Velcro wrist stays,  and a chest pocket that it packs into and can clip into a carabiner. All of its zippers are coated with a waterproof DWR coating. 

The stretchy fabric it is made of feels amazingly soft and it is super breathable. It does not have a hard shell feel to it at all and is very comfortable for casual wear or high output activity. If you are familiar with Patagonia products, imagine a little bit heavier, but way more wind and waterproof Houdini.  I would say it is similar to the Outdoor Research Helium II and Marmot Essence, but better.

Hoods are normally a big concern of mine in rain shells, but this helmet- compatible hood cinches down tight easily and stays in place.

The fit is a regular fit, with appropriate room for layers. Some say it runs big, but I think it is true to size and built to accommodate layering. If you want a more snug and flattering fit, size down.

It pairs wonderfully with the Patagonia R1 or any of stretchy synthetic insulated  jackets ( Nano Air, Nano Air Hybrid, Arc'teryx Atom LT, The North Face Ventrix). It would be great for anything from spring backcountry skiing to hiking or climbing your favorite fourteener.

I wore it all day long in the rain and snow in Yellowstone last weekend and stayed bone dry and comfortable. My only complaint is that it can get kind of soggy after heavy rain or being out in rain for long periods of time. Wearing it with another layer made it perfectly fine, but if you are only wearing a t-shirt under it, it might feel clammy on your skin. You will stay completely dry due to Patagonia's proprietary H2NO membrane, but it can get clammy. As long as you don't have expectations for this to be a 3L Gore-Tex Pro shell, you will love it.

Bottom line: This is one of my favorite rain shells I've ever worn. I'm going to wear it every chance I get.

It is also stretchy enough to move comfortably with your body without feeling tight or restrained.

So light and thin that I fear it won't be warm enough, but I'm reserving judgement on that until I've tested it. This winter in Ohio has been spring so far, with high temps in the 50s and 60s, so I can't really test this yet. I will say that on the 40 and 50 degree mornings, I've thrown this on and I did not overheat. It is very breathable and comfortable. It seems to stand up well against wind. If this thing truly takes me down through the winter temps as well, it will be the most versatile jacket I've ever owned. Fingers crossed and I will update once I've put it through more testing. The fit is absolutely amazing. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to layer under it because it seems so form fitting, and yet, somehow there is still space in here to layer. I should mention that I'm a 34 B, so your mileage may vary. The movement in the arms at the shoulder and elbow are like no jacket I've ever owned. Seriously, the arms/shoulders/elbows are brilliantly constructed for amazing ease of movement without the jacket riding up or limiting motion. I could do yoga in this jacket. Wow. Just wow. The collar is perfectly designed and very soft and comfortable when zipped up. There is even a little extra webbing along the top of the back in between the inner body of the coat and the hood, which provides coverage at the back of the neck when the hood is not on your head. Nice touch! No scarf needed. The hood fits brilliantly, gives great coverage, yet doesn't limit vision. I love that the hood is adjustable, great for those days when I wear my hair up in a bun or wear a bike helmet. The hood is designed to accommodate a helmet and has lots of volume. I do have a large, long head and a lot of hair, but with the adjustable design and brow construction, even those will smaller heads and less hair will likely still get a useable fit even when not wearing a helmet. This jacket works great as a mid layer too. Perfect stream lined fit under rain coats/outer shells. The design on the cuffs is the most comfortable I've had. Seamless coverage on the wrist with no constriction and no annoying buttons, velcro, or snaps etc. Slides under an outer layer like butter. Stays put when I move my arm around. The sleeves are very long, very long indeed, but the extra coverage is kinda nice and adds to the ease of movement. The fit overall is flattering and trim; doesn't make you look like a marshmallow. Rugged and ready for camp and trail, yet just stylish enough to get by for downtown walks. I have the black color. Mine arrived looking like it had been stuck in a backpack- lots of wrinkles, but its other charms have me overlooking the wrinkles. I should mention that the material makes a fairly noticeable crinkly sound, (if that kinda thing bothers you), another easily overlooked trait given the superior comfort and design. The only small quibbles I really have is that the coat seems a bit short in the front. Maybe I just have a long torso, but this does not really reach hip length on me. It feels just about an inch or two too short of where I'd comfortably expect it to be for good torso coverage. Also the hand pockets are just a bit shallow, could use a smidge more depth. But these are minor complaints on such a brilliant work of art. Certainly still deserving of this initial 5 star rating. I will update once it's handled some actual winter weather.

"Patagonia","Piolet Jacket - Women's","6189062",5,"I bought this a month ago and finally took it skiing in CO this weekend. I wore it over just a light longsleeve baselayer and my new NanoAir vest in 25F and was warm skiing. The pit vents dump heat quickly and the pockets were easily accessible with my ski pack on. I love the amount of pockets too with the chest, internal chest, and hand pockets. 

This was the first time I was able to comfortably wear my hood while skiing. It fit well over my helmet and the collar design allowed for full head/neck mobility without reducing visibility. Using the hood without a helmet is nice as it helps shield the face with the mini-bill and cinches down comfortably and doesn't fly off. The front zips up to cover your chin comfortably and adds a lot to warmth on the lifts or in strong winds.

I bought a large so it would fit over my down puffy in extreme temps and it doesn't look too big on it's own. I'm 5'9, 150lbs and wear a sm-med for more form fitting pieces for reference. The length was perfect for skiing and not having a powder skirt was no problem after cinching down the drawstring on the bottom. Plenty of mobility on the slopes, I wouldn't want it any smaller as it's not stretchy. 

My only quip is the zipper tabs. I wear mitten-style gloves and had to keep removing them in order to pull the pit zips open/closed. I'll add duct tape for extra ease/bulk. 

Overall exactly what I wanted in a ski shell. Handled well in light powder and heavy, wet, deep snow. I use this at home as my rain shell and haven't had any complaints in the heavy downpours in Georgia. ","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2017-01-12 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""

Being just a 2L shell I was skeptical but, I have done a lot of cold summits with Patagonia's 2L shells before. This one performs and keeps her dry amidst any snow. Probably would get wet eventually in the rain but, she has a dedicated rain shell for that.

The amount of insulation is perfect! Its a bit much for her to tour in but, inbounds 30-40 degrees she can just wear the jacket with a good warm base layer. Colder than that she usually wears a lighter base layer and another insulating jacket.

If you're familiar with the Arc'teryx Atom, this jacket has a similar soft, stretchy outer fabric. The cinch at the bottom prevents it from riding up under your shell, which I find is something I run into frequently.  The pockets are up high so you can still access them if you're wearing it under your backpack or under a harness. 

Fit: 

I would say this jacket fits true to size.

-Fabric is very durable
-When soaked it still stays insulated

Cons:
-This will get soaked if you are in a humid environment â also gets wet in the rain, and snow (as to be expected) works great with a shell.
-The jacket, worn with the wrong pants, can either make you look like a 90âs mom, or a child over bundled in ski gear â however I would take functionality over fashion, and the functionality of this jacket definitely outweighs the fit.

But I feel it's lacking just a little bit, so I snatched up the Marmot Astrum hoping it would leave me satisfied as most all the other Marmot gear I own has. 

First, I must start by saying this puppy is WARM. It's really nice on fall days, only really need a t-shirt underneath, so I imagine it's going to be a key player in the colder months to come. 

Second, the stretch of the material lets me know that it's going to keep up with all I need it to so and I won't feel like I'm going to tear through it.

Third, the pockets are nice, with a little fuzzy lining to add that lil extra somethin' somethin' on colder days. Also, it's nice having an internal pocket, I haven't had that in a jacket like this before. I just toss my phone in there and go!

Just about my only complaint I can think of is that sizing across the board in Marmot coats isn't universal. In other jackets, like the Marmot Jena Down, I need a large for my hips.

Since then I've used this fleece for many many different activities other than skiing  including road trips, flights, dog walking, cold winter sunday morning brunches in pjs, etc.....

It fits well - skims the body - and not tight anywhere. I can easily wear a light layer underneath with no problem. As well as a layer on top since it's not bulky like some fleeces are. It hits at your hip so not too long it gets in the way and not too short that you expose lower back or belly when you lift up your arms. 

It has a useful left top-of-arm pocket as well as side hand warming pockets. It's soft, stretchy so you can move easily and it comes in great colors (I have azulene).

The only downside with it is that if you sweat enough in it, it will smell afterwards and need washing. So it's not great for repeated hard activity wearing unless you don't care about being smelly.

"Patagonia","R3 Hooded Fleece Jacket - Women's","106312630",5,"A friend of mine had been talking non-stop about how awesome her R3 was, so I figured as a Professional Fleece Aficionado I should weigh in on the whole situation. 

Reader's Digest Version: Hands down the fluffiest, coziest, easy-to-wear and thermally efficient fleece I have in my line up. 

Ages ago I picked up an R3 (orangutan orange mind you) and the high loft fibers shed all over everything I owned, leaving a very barren fleece - so I was a bit apprehensive of giving the R3 another go, but I'm so glad I did. The new and improved R3 touts a shorter fleece that doesn't shed, wicks away moisture, dries quickly, and assures warmth when you need it most. All in all, I love the fact that the R3 promotes cozy warmth while being incredibly lightweight and packable. Sometimes when I'm traveling, I roll the jacket up into the hood and use it as an impromptu pillow.

Perhaps my favorite part about this fleece is the fact that it's totally reversible! One side features a longer, loftier fleece for colder days, and the other has a shorter fleece for warmer days. Whoa, hello, imagine my surprise when I discovered that! One side has a chest pocket and the other has hand pockets. Additionally, my second favorite part about this fleece are the cuffs - super low-profile and slim without cutting off the blood flow to your hands (obviously crucial). 

My only beef is the oversized collar and hood, which I know is for helmet-compatible purposes and warmth and what have you, but it's a little bit much when you're wearing it unzipped. 

As for the fit, I picked up a Small, which is a big long and slightly relaxed, but I love it regardless. I think that if I were to purchase another fleece, I would go with an XS instead. For fit reference, I wear an XS in just about all Patagonia items, but can wear a Small when I'm looking to have a more relaxed fit. Additionally, I wear an XS in Arc'teryx and XS in Prana items.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-11-29 00:00:00","",""
"Patagonia","R3 Hooded Fleece Jacket - Women's","106248007",4,"I was hesitant in ordering this jacket as I wanted something packable for travel but just a bit softer and warmer than my nanopuff and reviews seem iffy. I ordered the  ultramarine thinking it seemed to be a versatile enough combo....
Upon receipt I LOVE the weight, comfort, and versatility of the jacket itself. There is a definite warmth variable depending on which side you wear out which makes it that much more functional. A few things to note, and maybe I just wasn't being that observant, but the hand pockets are only on the side without the chest pocket. They are NOT accessible from both sides!!!! I also ended up returning the ultramarine and ordering the rustic purple (which I haven't received yet) because the ultramarine is highlighter blue. It's kind of pretty with my blue shoes but it literally reflects that blue onto my face as if it were glowing which, due to my tan skin, makes me look reptilian and sick. Reflective highlighter blue is also very difficult to match with a pair of shorts/pants. This also makes it harder for use in a capsule wardrobe. On the other hand, if you are in the back country it would be FANTASTIC for not losing hiking buddies in the wilderness or flagging aircraft if necessary. Something to consider.

It's close-fitting, yet the sides are stretchy so lots of movement.  Have had this jacket for several years, well worth it.  I got the roseberry color and love it.  Most recently layered it under a shell for 8 degree skiing at Snowbird, UT!  First time layering for cold and it performed perfectly!","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2016-02-17 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Arc'teryx","Atom LT Jacket - Women's","3486078",4,"... but really, just a touch. This is a great jacket for temps in the 30s (under a shell) or 50s-60s (alone) but if you're looking for some serious insulation, this is not for you. I know, it says ""LT"" -- take that seriously, and if you need something truly warm, go for the AR version instead. 
That being said, this jacket is fantastic when you just need a little warmth - super lightweight, very breathable, and very easy to layer over. Truly a 3-season jacket that can span a range of conditions. It's also very easy to layer over. I got the non-hooded version for maximum versatility.
Like some Arc'teryx items, the fit is a bit of a mystery -- some things run small, while others are large; this one is in the latter category. If you're between sizes, I would recommend sizing down rather than up.","EMPLOYEE","2016-02-04 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Arc'teryx","Atom LT Jacket - Women's","106552293",4,"My wife has one of these and she loves it. The material is made out of dragon skin because she beats this to shit and  has never had a rip or tear in the material.

Insulation: its that perfect mid layer fill! keeps you warm!
Fit: its going to be close to your body to keep you warm.

Pro: Durable, Warm, and Lifetime Warranty

Cons: she wished she would have gotten the one with the hood.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-11-04 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Arc'teryx","Atom LT Jacket - Women's","100451057",5,"That's 5'-7"" Katie in a size small Atom LT jacket. We rode my motorcycle to a walk around Ada Hayden Lake in Ames, Iowa and the Atom LT held back the morning's 26 deg wind chill temp. We both think the Atom LT is a great jacket (I've had mine for over 4 years). It's warm and lightweight and just feels great. With its athletic/trim cut, it looks great too. Highly recommended.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2015-03-15 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""

"Arc'teryx","Atom LT Jacket - Women's","664988",5,"Close-fitting jacket works great alone for cold biking or under a shell for skiing. Very lightweight but very warm for what it is. Stretchy on the sides, wind and waterproof elsewhere. Nice deep pockets, no pit zips, tight cuffs on the sleeves. Good for a variety of uses. Longer in back keeps your butt warm too. Attractive fit a lot like the women's Marmot fit. I found it to run just a touch small - maybe just felt that way because it is so close-fitting. My normal size worked. I will use it a lot.  The product description is very accurate and like any Arc'teryx product, the quality is superb.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-11-18 00:00:00","I've used it several times",""
"Arc'teryx","Atom LT Jacket - Women's","2686182",5,"I love this ultra light jacket.  With its articulated sleeves and close fit it feels great over a light fleece or anything for that matter.  Water beaded nicely in rain on last hike.  It is a close fit, but has a little pouf to it - fabric feels light but takes a beating...Typical awesome Arc'teryx quality.  Perfect for cold (not sub-zero) hikes and runs or with it's close fit, as a layering piece.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2014-10-30 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
"Arc'teryx","Atom LT Jacket - Women's","625450935",5,"I love love love this jacket!!! Here's some reasons why:

- incredibly comfortable
- super light 
- compresses down to pretty darn small
- articulated elbows (no tight feeling when bending the arms or bunching on the inside of your elbow)
- dries fast
- small wrists (keeps out wind and great for layering)
- smooth zipper (Arc'teryx quality everything)
- fits and looks great

This jacket is super awesome for a few different activities. I bought it initially for wearing with my drysuit (on winter river trips) because the slim sleeve design fits well under a drysuit with gasketed wrists, but then I found out once I had it, it's the best cold weather running jacket I've ever worn! (By cold, I mean cold). 

I am 5'5"", 105 lbs, measurements are 30x24x34 and I went with a small. I could've done an XS (I tried them both on) and I went with the small for the extra length in the torse, but either worked fit wise.","NOT_EMPLOYEE","2013-10-24 00:00:00","I've put it through the wringer",""
