The default value of 0.001 is a good place to start. You should increase this value if the training loss is changing very slowly, and decrease if the loss is unstable.  \n",

    "Looking at the training curves above, it seems that the model's training is going well. The loss is decreasing steadily, and the accuracy is approaching 100 percent. However, when analyzing training curves, we should also pay special attention to the possibility of our model overfitting the training dataset. Overfitting is a common phenomenon in machine learning where a model becomes so fit to the training data that it loses the ability to generalize to the test set. This means that training a network until you achieve 0 training loss might not be the best way to get an accurate model that performs well on data it has never seen before. Early stopping is an intuitive technique commonly used with LSTM networks to combat this issue. The basic idea is that we train the model on our training set, while also measuring its performance on the test set every now and again. Once the test error stops its steady decrease and begins to increase instead, you'll know to stop training, since this is a sign that the network has begun to overfit. "
