## Product Review Scraper and Brand Sentiment Analysis

This is my first full project. The primary goal was to practice web scraping and NLP techniques, which included regex and spaCy. SpaCy did not make it into the final project though because spaCy was computationally intensive and regex was sufficient. Using a pre-trained LSTM to predict sentiment regardless of the user's provided rating was a secondary goal that was added to round out the project and give a purpose to the data. O'Reilly's Sentiment Analysis with LSTMs tutorial was key to building the pre-trained model.
